************************
* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation; this  has  been confirmed by a recent [4] statistical
analysis of glycosylation sites, which also  shows that about 50% of the sites
that have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

* Glycosaminoglycan attachment site *
*************************************

Proteoglycans [1]  are  complex  glycoconjugates  containing a core protein to
which a variable number of glycosaminoglycan chains  (such as heparin sulfate,
chondroitin sulfate, etc.) are covalently attached. The glycosaminoglycans are
attached to  the  core  proteins through  a xyloside residue which is  in turn
linked to  a serine   residue of the protein.    A consensus sequence for  the
attachment  site seems  to exist [2].   However,  it must be noted  that  this
consensus is only based on the sequence of three proteoglycan core proteins.

-Consensus pattern: S-G-x-G
                    [S is the attachment site]
 Additional rule: There must be at least  two acidic amino acids from -2 to -4
                  relative to the serine.

* Tyrosine sulfation site *
***************************

The consensus  features  of  a tyrosine  sulfation site have been described in
a number of reviews [1,2,3]:

 - The presence of an acidic (Glu or Asp)  amino acid  within  two residues of
   the tyrosine (typically at -1).
 - The presence of at least three acidic residues from -5 to +5.
 - No more  than  one basic residue  and three hydrophobic residues from -5 to
   +5.
 - Presence of turn-inducing amino acids: at  least one Pro or Gly  (the amino
   acids with  the  strongest turn potential) from -7 to -2 and from +1 to +7,
   or at least two or three Asp, Ser or Asn from -7 to +7.
 - Absence of disulfide-bonded cysteine residues from -7 to +7.
 - Absence of N-linked glycans near the tyrosine.

It must  be  noted that tyrosine sulfation is physiologically relevant only to
proteins or domains passing through or located in the Golgi lumen.

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

* Casein kinase II phosphorylation site *
*****************************************

Casein kinase II (CK-2) is a protein serine/threonine kinase whose activity is
independent of  cyclic  nucleotides   and  calcium.  CK-2  phosphorylates many
different proteins.   The  substrate  specificity [1]  of  this  enzyme can be
summarized as follows:

 (1) Under comparable conditions Ser is favored over Thr.
 (2) An acidic residue (either Asp or Glu) must be present three residues from
     the C-terminal of the phosphate acceptor site.
 (3) Additional acidic  residues in  positions +1, +2, +4, and +5 increase the
     phosphorylation rate.  Most  physiological  substrates  have at least one
     acidic residue in these positions.
 (4) Asp is preferred to Glu as the provider of acidic determinants.
 (5) A basic residue at the N-terminal  of the  acceptor  site  decreases  the
     phosphorylation rate, while an acidic one will increase it.

-Consensus pattern: [ST]-x(2)-[DE]

Substrates of tyrosine protein kinases are generally characterized by a lysine
or an arginine seven residues  to  the N-terminal side  of  the phosphorylated
tyrosine.  An acidic residue (Asp  or Glu) is often  found at either  three or
four residues to  the N-terminal side  of  the tyrosine  [1,2,3].  There are a
number of exceptions to  this rule such as the  tyrosine phosphorylation sites
of enolase and lipocortin II.

* N-myristoylation site *
*************************

An  appreciable  number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  acylated by the covalent
addition of myristate (a C14-saturated fatty acid) to their N-terminal residue
via an amide linkage [1,2]. The sequence specificity of the enzyme responsible
for this  modification,   myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase (NMT),
has been  derived from the sequence of known N-myristoylated proteins and from
studies using synthetic peptides. It seems to be the following:

 - The N-terminal residue must be glycine.
 - In position 2, uncharged residues  are allowed.  Charged residues,  proline
   and large hydrophobic residues are not allowed.
 - In positions 3 and 4, most, if not all, residues are allowed.
 - In position  5,  small uncharged  residues are allowed (Ala, Ser, Thr, Cys,
   Asn and Gly). Serine is favored.
 - In position 6, proline is not allowed.

-Consensus pattern: G-{EDRKHPFYW}-x(2)-[STAGCN]-{P}
                    [G is the N-myristoylation site]

-Note: we  deliberately include as  potential myristoylated  glycine residues,
 those which  are  internal  to a sequence. It could well be that the sequence
 under study  represents  a  viral  polyprotein  precursor and that subsequent
 proteolytic processing  could expose an internal glycine as the N-terminal of
 a mature protein.

The precursor of  hormones  and other active  peptides  which are C-terminally
amidated is always directly followed [1,2] by a glycine residue which provides
the amide group, and  most often by at  least two  consecutive  basic residues
(Arg or Lys) which generally function as an active peptide  precursor cleavage
site.  Although all amino acids can be amidated,  neutral hydrophobic residues
such as Val or Phe are good substrates, while  charged residues such as Asp or
Arg  are much less reactive.  C-terminal  amidation has not  yet been shown to
occur in unicellular organisms or in plants.

factors VII, IX and X, proteins C, S, and Z, the LDL receptor, thrombomodulin,
etc.  Based on sequence comparisons  of the EGF-homology region  that contains

* Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation domain *
********************************************

Vitamin K-dependent carboxylation [1,2] is the post-translational modification
of glutamic  residues  to form gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Proteins known to
contain Gla are listed below.

 - A number of plasma proteins involved in blood coagulation.   These proteins
   are prothrombin, coagulation factors VII, IX and X, proteins C, S, and Z.
 - Two proteins that  occur  in calcified tissues:  osteocalcin (also known as
   bone-Gla protein, BGP), and matrix Gla-protein (MGP).
 - Cone snail venom peptides: conantokin-G and -T, and conotoxin GS [3].

With the  exception  of  the  snail  toxins,  all  these  proteins  contain an
N-terminal module  of  about  forty  amino acids where the majority of the Glu
residues are carboxylated.  This  domain is  responsible for the high-affinity
binding of calcium ions.  The Gla-domain starts at the N-terminal extremity of
the mature  form of these proteins and ends with a conserved aromatic residue;
a conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x-Cys motif [4] is  found in the middle of the domain
which seems to be important for substrate recognition by the carboxylase.

-Note: all glutamic residues present in the domain are potential carboxylation
 sites; in coagulation proteins, all are modified to Gla, while in BGP and MGP
 some are not.

**************************************
* Phosphopantetheine attachment site *
**************************************

Phosphopantetheine (or pantetheine 4' phosphate) is  the  prosthetic  group of
acyl carrier proteins (ACP) in some  multienzyme complexes  where it serves as
a 'swinging  arm'  for  the  attachment of activated fatty acid and amino-acid
groups [1].  Phosphopantetheine  is  attached  to  a  serine  residue in these
proteins [2].  ACP  proteins  or   domains  have  been found in various enzyme
systems which  are  listed  below  (references  are only provided for recently
determined sequences).

 - Fatty acid synthetase (FAS),  which catalyzes  the formation  of long-chain
   fatty acids    from  acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH. Bacterial and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   the  different  enzymatic  activities;  ACP  is  one of these polypeptides.
   Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and FAS2; the ACP
   domain is  located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of  FAS2.  Vertebrate FAS
   consists of a single  multifunctional  enzyme;  the ACP  domain  is located
   between the beta-ketoacyl reductase  domain and the C-terminal thioesterase
   domain [3].
 - Polyketide antibiotics  synthase enzyme systems.  Polyketides are secondary
   metabolites produced from simple fatty acids, by microorganisms and plants.
   ACP is one of the polypeptidic  components  involved in the biosynthesis of
   Streptomyces polyketide  antibiotics  actinorhodin,  curamycin, granatacin,
   monensin, oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin C.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  putative polyketide synthases pksK, pksL and pksM which
   respectively contain three, five and one ACP domains.
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium
   patulum. This is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a
   polyketide antibiotic  and  which  contains an ACP domain in the C-terminal
   extremity.
 - Multifunctional  mycocerosic  acid  synthase  (gene mas) from Mycobacterium
   bovis.
 - Gramicidin S synthetase I (gene grsA)  from  Bacillus brevis.  This  enzyme
   catalyzes the first step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  cyclic antibiotic
   gramicidin S.
 - Tyrocidine synthetase I (gene tycA)  from  Bacillus  brevis.   The reaction
   carried out by tycA is identical to that catalyzed by grsA
 - Gramicidin S synthetase II (gene grsB)  from  Bacillus brevis. This  enzyme
   is a  multifunctional  protein  that  activates  and  polymerizes  proline,
   valine, ornithine and leucine. GrsB contains four ACP domains.
 - Erythronolide synthase proteins 1, 2 and 3 from Saccharopolyspora erythraea
   which is   involved  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  polyketide  antibiotic
   erythromicin. Each of these proteins contain two ACP domains.
 - Conidial green pigment synthase from Aspergillus nidulans.
 - ACV synthetase from various fungi. This enzyme catalyzes the first  step in
   the biosynthesis  of  penicillin  and  cephalosporin. It contains three ACP
   domains.
 - Enterobactin synthetase component F (gene entF) from Escherichia coli. This
   enzyme is  involved  in  the  ATP-dependent  activation  of  serine  during
   enterobactin (enterochelin) biosynthesis.
 - Cyclic  peptide  antibiotic  surfactin  synthase  subunits  1, 2 and 3 from
   Bacillus subtilis.  Subunits  1  and 2 contains three related domains while
   subunit 3 only contains a single domain.
 - HC-toxin  synthetase  (gene  HTS1)  from Cochliobolus carbonum. This enzyme
   synthesizes HC-toxin,   a  cyclic  tetrapeptide.  HTS1  contains  four  ACP
   domains.
 - Fungal mitochondrial ACP [9], which  is  part of the respiratory chain NADH
   dehydrogenase (complex I).
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodF,  which  probably  acts  as an ACP in the
   synthesis of the nodulation Nod factor fatty acyl chain.

The sequence around the phosphopantetheine attachment site is conserved in all
these proteins  and  can  be  used  as a signature pattern. A profile was also
developed that spans the complete ACP-like domain.

In prokaryotes, membrane lipoproteins are synthesized  with a precursor signal
peptide, which is cleaved  by  a specific lipoprotein signal peptidase (signal
peptidase II). The peptidase recognizes a conserved sequence and cuts upstream
of a cysteine residue  to which a  glyceride-fatty acid lipid is attached [1].
Some of  the  proteins known to undergo such processing currently include (for
recent listings see [1,2,3]):

 - Major outer membrane lipoprotein (murein-lipoproteins) (gene lpp).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-28 (gene nlpA).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein-34 (gene nlpB).
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpC.
 - Escherichia coli lipoprotein nlpD.

 - Escherichia coli peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (gene pal).
 - Escherichia coli rare lipoproteins A and B (genes rplA and rplB).
 - Escherichia coli copper homeostasis protein cutF (or nlpE).
 - Escherichia coli plasmids traT proteins.
 - Escherichia coli Col plasmids lysis proteins.
 - A number of Bacillus beta-lactamases.

* Prokaryotic N-terminal methylation site *
*******************************************

A number of bacteria express filamentous adhesins known as pili.  The pili are
polar flexible filaments of about 5.4 nm diameter and  2500 nm average length;
they  consist of a single polypeptide chain (called pilin or fimbrial protein)
arranged in a helical configuration of five subunits per turn in the assembled
pilus.  Gram-negative  bacteria  produce  pilin which are characterized by the
presence of a  very  short  leader  peptide  of 6 to 7 residues, followed by a
methylated N-terminal phenylalanine residue and by a highly conserved sequence
of about 24 hydrophobic residues.  This class of pilin is often referred to as
NMePhe or type-4 pili [1,2].

Recently a number  of  bacterial proteins  have been sequenced which share the
following structural characteristics with type-4 pili [3]:

 a) The N-terminal residue, which  is  methylated, is hydrophobic (generally a
    phenylalanine or a methionine);
 b) The leader peptide is hydrophilic, consists of 5 to  10 residues (with two
    exceptions, see below) and ends with a glycine;
 c) The fifth residue of the mature  sequence is a glutamate which seems to be
    required for the methylation step;
 d) The first twenty residues of the mature sequence are highly hydrophobic.

These proteins are listed below:

 - Four proteins in an operon  involved  in  a general secretion pathway (GSP)
   for  the export  of  proteins (also called the type II pathway) [4].  These
   proteins have  been  assigned  a different gene name in each of the species
   where they have been sequenced:

all these proteins.

A number of eukaryotic  proteins  are  post-translationally  modified  by  the

******************************
* Protein splicing signature *
******************************

Protein splicing  [1,2,3,4,E1]  is  a  mechanism  by which an internal segment
(called intein  [5]  or  spacer)  in  a  protein  precursor is excised and the
flanking regions  (called  exteins  [5])  are religated to create a functional
protein. Currently, such a mechanism has been found in the following proteins:

 - Vacuolar ATP synthase catalytic subunit A (gene VMA1 or TFP1) from  budding
   yeast and from Candida tropicalis
 - recA protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae.
 - DNA   polymerase   from   the  archaebacteria  Thermococcus  litoralis  and
   Pyrococcus strains GB-D and KOD1.
 - clpP protease from the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas eugametos.
 - dnaB protein from the chloroplast of Porphyra purpurea.
 - gyrA (DNA gyrase subunit A) from various Mycobacterial species.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii TFIIB.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0682.

In most  of  these  cases  the intein seems to be an endonuclease. It has been
proposed  that  the splicing initiates at the C-terminal splice junction.  The
delta-nitrogen group  of a  conserved  asparagine residue makes a nucleophilic
attack on  the  peptide  bond  that links this asparagine to the next residue.
The next  residue  (a Cys, Ser or Thr) is then free to attack the peptide bond
at the N-terminal splice junction by a transpeptidation reaction that releases
the intein  and  creates  a  new  peptide  bond.  Such  a mechanism is briefly
schematized in the following figures.

 1) Primary translation product

      +---------------+  +-------------+  +--------------+
  NH2-| Extein 1      x--y Intein      N--z Extein 2     |-COOH
      +---------------+  +-------------+  +--------------+

 2) Breakage of the peptide bond at the C-terminal splice junction by
    nucleophilic attack of the asparagine.

      +---------------+  +-------------+      +--------------+
  NH2-| Extein 1      x--y Intein      N  NH2-z Extein 2     |-COOH
      +---------------+  +-------------+      +--------------+

 3) Transpeptidation to produce the final products.

      +---------------+  +-------------+           +--------------+
  NH2-| Extein 1      x--z Extein 2    |-COOH  NH2-y Intein       N
      +---------------+  +-------------+           +--------------+

In the  proteins  known to undergo protein splicing, the residues close to the
asparagine involved  in  the nucleophilic attack are conserved and can be used
as a  signature  pattern. We are aware that such a signature is probably going
to evolve  as  soon  as  new examples are discovered, nevertheless, we believe
that it can be useful.

* Endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence *
********************************************

Proteins  that permanently reside in the  lumen  of  the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) seem to be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins by the
presence of  the C-terminal  sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) [1,2]. While KDEL
is the preferred signal in many species, variants  of  that signal are used by
different species. This situation is described in the following table.

   Signal   Species
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   KDEL     Vertebrates, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants
   HDEL     Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, plants
   DDEL     Kluyveromyces lactis
   ADEL     Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast)
   SDEL     Plasmodium falciparum

The signal is usually very  strictly  conserved in  major ER proteins but some
minor ER  proteins  have   divergent  sequences  (probably  because  efficient
retention of these proteins is not crucial to the cell).

Proteins bearing the KDEL-type signal are  not simply held in the ER,  but are
selectively retrieved from a post-ER compartment by a receptor and returned to
their normal location.

The currently known ER luminal proteins are listed below.

 - Protein  disulphide-isomerase  (PDI)  (also  known  as  the beta-subunit of
   prolyl 4-hydroxylase, as  a  component  of  oligosaccharyl  transferase, as
   glutathione-insulin  transhydrogenase  and  as  a  thyroid  hormone binding
   protein).
 - ERp60, ERp72, and P5, three minor isoforms of PDI.
 - Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream-specific protein 2, a probable PDI.
 - hsp70  related  protein GRP78 (also known as the immunoglobulin heavy chain
   binding protein (BiP), and as KAR2, in fungi).
 - hsp90 related protein 'endoplasmin' (also known as GRP94, Erp99 or Hsp108).
 - Calreticulin, a  calcium-binding protein (also  known as calregulin, CRP55,
   or HACBP).
 - ERC-55, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Reticulocalbin, a calcium-binding protein.
 - Hsp47, a heat-shock protein that  binds  strongly to collagen and could act
   as a chaperone in the collagen biosynthetic pathway.
 - A receptor for a plant hormone, auxin.
 - Thiol proteases from rice bean (SH-EP) and kidney bean (EP-C1).
 - Esterases from mammalian liver and from nematodes.
 - Alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor-associated protein (RAP).
 - Yeast peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D (CYPD).
 - Yeast protein KRE5, a protein required for (1->6)-beta-D-glucan synthesis.
 - Yeast  protein  SEC20,  required    for  the transport of proteins from the
   endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus.
 - Yeast protein SCJ1, involved in protein sorting.

* Microbodies C-terminal targeting signal *
*******************************************

Microbodies are  a class of small, single membraned organelles to which belong
peroxisomes, glyoxysomes,  and  glycosomes. Microbody proteins are synthesized
on free polysomes and imported into the organelle post-translationally. Unlike
the import  of  proteins  into  mitochondria, chloroplasts or the ER/secretion
pathway, import  into  microbodies does not generally require the removal of a
presequence [1].  It  has  been  experimentally  shown  [2,3,4]  that, in some
peroxisomal proteins,  the  targeting  signal  (PTS) resides in the last three
amino acids  of  the  C-terminus.  This consensus sequence is known as 'S-K-L'
(Ser-Lys-Leu), although some variations are allowed in all three positions. As
the peroxisomal  targeting  signal  also  seems  to    be  recognized by other
microbodies, it  is now [1] known as the C-terminal microbody targeting signal
(CMTS).

It must  be noted that not all microbody proteins contain a CMTS; some seem to
contain an  internal  CMTS-like  sequence,  but  it  is not yet known if it is
active as such. Finally, a  few  proteins are  synthesized  with an N-terminal
presequence which is cleaved off during import.

Microbody proteins known or thought to contain a CMTS are listed below.

 - Mammalian D-amino acid oxidase.
 - Mammalian acyl-coenzyme A oxidase (but not the fungal enzymes).
 - Mammalian and yeast (S. cerevisiae) carnitine o-acetyltransferase.
 - Mammalian trifunctional fatty acid beta oxidation pathway enzyme.

 - Plants and fungal glyoxisomal malate synthase.

Surface  proteins from  Gram-positive cocci  contains a  conserved hexapeptide
located a few residues downstream of a hydrophobic  C-terminal membrane anchor
region which is followed by a cluster of basic amino acids [1]. This structure

  +--------------------------------------------+-+--------+-+
  |    Variable length extracellular domain    |H| Anchor |B|
  +--------------------------------------------+-+--------+-+

  'H': conserved hexapeptide.

It has been proposed that this hexapeptide sequence is responsible for a post-

which bear it, to the cell wall.

* Bipartite nuclear targeting sequence *

The uptake  of protein by  the   nucleus  is extremely selective   and nuclear
proteins must therefore  contain within  their final  structure a signal  that
specifies selective accumulation in the nucleus [1,2]. Studies on some nuclear
proteins, such as  the  large T antigen of SV40,  have indicated which part of
the sequence  is  required  for  nuclear  translocation.   The  known  nuclear
targeting sequences  are   generally  basic, but  there  seems to  be no clear
common denominator  between  all the known sequences.  Although some consensus
sequence patterns have  been proposed (see for example [3]),  the current best
strategy to detect a nuclear targeting sequence is based [4] on  the following
definition of what is called a 'bipartite nuclear targeting sequence':

  (1) Two adjacent basic amino acids (Arg or Lys).
  (2) A spacer region of any 10 residues.
  (3) At least three basic residues (Arg or Lys) in the five positions
      after the spacer region.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: 56% of known

* ATP/GTP-binding site motif A (P-loop) *
*****************************************

From sequence comparisons and crystallographic data analysis it has been shown
[1,2,3,4,5,6] that an appreciable proportion of proteins that  bind ATP or GTP
share a number of more or less conserved sequence motifs.   The best conserved
of these  motifs  is  a  glycine-rich region, which typically forms a flexible
loop between a beta-strand and an alpha-helix. This loop interacts with one of
the phosphate  groups  of  the  nucleotide.   This sequence motif is generally
referred to as the 'A' consensus sequence [1] or the 'P-loop' [5].

There are numerous ATP- or GTP-binding proteins  in which the P-loop is found.
We list below  a number of protein  families  for  which  the relevance of the
presence of such motif has been noted:

 - ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits (see <PDOC00137>).
 - Myosin heavy chains.
 - Kinesin heavy chains and kinesin-like proteins (see <PDOC00343>).
 - Dynamins and dynamin-like proteins (see <PDOC00362>).
 - Guanylate kinase (see <PDOC00670>).
 - Thymidine kinase (see <PDOC00524>).

Not all ATP- or GTP-binding proteins are picked-up by this motif.  A number of
proteins escape detection because the structure   of their ATP-binding site is
completely different from that of the P-loop.  Examples  of  such proteins are
the E1-E2 ATPases or  the  glycolytic kinases.   In  other ATP- or GTP-binding
proteins the flexible loop exists  in a  slightly different form; this is  the
case for tubulins or protein kinases.  A special mention must  be reserved for
adenylate  kinase,  in  which  there  is a  single  deviation  from the P-loop
pattern: in the last position Gly is found instead of Ser or Thr.

-Consensus pattern: [AG]-x(4)-G-K-[ST]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a majority.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: in addition to the proteins  listed
 above,  the 'A' motif is also  found in a number  of other proteins.  Most of
 these proteins  probably  bind  a nucleotide, but others are definitively not
 ATP- or GTP-binding (as for example  chymotrypsin,  or  human  ferritin light
 chain).

* Cyclic nucleotide-binding domain signatures and profile *
***********************************************************

Proteins that bind cyclic nucleotides (cAMP or cGMP) share a structural domain
of about  120  residues  [1-3].  The  best  studied  of  these proteins is the
prokaryotic catabolite  gene  activator  (also  known  as  the  cAMP  receptor
protein) (gene  crp)  where  such  a  domain  is known to be composed of three
alpha-helices and  a    distinctive   eight-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel
structure. Such a domain is known to exist in the following proteins:

 - Prokaryotic catabolite gene activator protein (CAP).
 - cAMP-  and  cGMP-dependent  protein  kinases (cAPK and cGPK). Both types of
   kinases contains two tandem copies of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain.
   The cAPK's  are composed of two different subunits: a catalytic chain and a
   regulatory chain  which  contains both copies of the domain. The cGPK's are
   single chain  enzymes that include the two copies of the domain in their N-
   terminal section.  The nucleotide specificity of cAPK and cGPK is due to an
   amino acid  in  the  conserved region of beta-barrel 7: a threonine that is
   invariant in cGPK is an alanine in most cAPK.
 - Vertebrate  cyclic nucleotide-gated ion-channels. Two such cations channels
   have been  fully  characterized. One is found in rod cells where it plays a
   role in  visual  signal transduction. It specifically binds to cGMP leading
   to an  opening  of  the channel and thereby causing a depolarization of rod
   photoreceptors.  In  olfactory epithelium  a similar, cAMP-binding, channel
   plays a role in odorant signal transduction.

There are six invariant amino acids in this domain, three of which are glycine
residues that  are thought to be essential for  maintenance  of the structural
integrity of  the beta-barrel. We developed  two  signature patterns for  this
domain.  The first pattern is located within beta-barrels 2 and 3 and contains
the  first two  conserved  Gly. The second  pattern  is  located  within beta-
barrels 6  and  7  and  contains  the third conserved Gly as well as the three
other invariant residues.

* EF-hand calcium-binding domain *
**********************************

Many calcium-binding proteins belong to the same evolutionary family and share
a type of calcium-binding  domain known as the EF-hand [1 to 5].  This type of
domain consists of  a  twelve  residue  loop flanked on both side by  a twelve
residue  alpha-helical  domain.   In  an  EF-hand  loop  the  calcium  ion  is
coordinated in  a  pentagonal  bipyramidal  configuration.  The  six  residues
involved in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12;  these residues
are denoted by X, Y, Z, -Y, -X and -Z. The invariant Glu or Asp at position 12
provides two oxygens for liganding Ca (bidentate ligand).

We list below the proteins  which  are  known to contain EF-hand  regions. For
each type of protein we have indicated between parenthesis the total number of
EF-hand regions known or supposed to exist.   This  number  does  not  include
regions which  clearly  have  lost  their  calcium-binding  properties, or the
atypical low-affinity site (which spans thirteen residues) found in the S-100/
ICaBP family of proteins [6].

 - Aequorin and Renilla luciferin binding protein (LBP) (Ca=3).
 - Alpha actinin (Ca=2).
 - Calbindin (Ca=4).
 - Calcineurin B subunit (protein phosphatase 2B regulatory subunit) (Ca=4).
 - Calcium-binding protein from Streptomyces erythraeus (Ca=3?).
 - Calcium-binding protein from Schistosoma mansoni (Ca=2?).
 - Calcium-binding  proteins  TCBP-23 and TCBP-25 from Tetrahymena thermophila
   (Ca=4?).
 - Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK) from plants (Ca=4).

 - Caltractin (centrin) (Ca=2 or 4).
 - Cell Division Control protein 31 (gene CDC31) from yeast (Ca=2?).
 - Diacylglycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.107) (DGK) (Ca=2).
 - FAD-dependent   glycerol-3-phosphate   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.99.5)  from
   mammals (Ca=1).

 - Flagellar calcium-binding protein (1f8) from Trypanosoma cruzi (Ca=1 or 2).
 - Guanylate cyclase activating protein (GCAP) (Ca=3).
 - Inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C isozymes gamma-1 and delta-1
   (Ca=2) [10].
 - Intestinal calcium-binding protein (ICaBPs) (Ca=2).
 - MIF related proteins 8 (MRP-8 or CFAG) and 14 (MRP-14) (Ca=2).
 - Myosin regulatory light chains (Ca=1).
 - Oncomodulin (Ca=2).
 - Osteonectin  (basement  membrane  protein  BM-40) (SPARC) and proteins that
   contains an  'osteonectin'  domain  (QR1, matrix glycoprotein SC1) (see the
   entry <PDOC00535>) (Ca=1).
 - Parvalbumins alpha and beta (Ca=2).
 - Placental  calcium-binding  protein  (18a2)  (nerve  growth  factor induced
   protein 42a) (p9k) (Ca=2).
 - Recoverins (visinin, hippocalcin, neurocalcin, S-modulin) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Reticulocalbin (Ca=4).
 - S-100 protein, alpha and beta chains (Ca=2).
 - Sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCPs) (Ca=2 to 3).
 - Sea urchin proteins Spec 1 (Ca=4), Spec 2 (Ca=4?), Lps-1 (Ca=8).
 - Serine/threonine  protein  phosphatase  rdgc  (EC 3.1.3.16) from Drosophila
   (Ca=2)
 - Sorcin V19 from hamster (Ca=2).
 - Spectrin alpha chain (Ca=2).
 - Squidulin (optic lobe calcium-binding protein) from squid (Ca=4).
 - Troponins C; from  skeletal muscle (Ca=4), from cardiac muscle (Ca=3), from
   arthropods and molluscs (Ca=2).

There has been a number of attempts [7,8] to develop patterns that pick-up EF-
hand regions, but  these  studies were  made  a few years ago when not so many
different families  of  calcium-binding  proteins  were  known.  We  therefore
developed a new pattern which takes into account all published sequences. This
pattern includes the complete EF-hand  loop as well as the first residue which
follows the loop and which seem to always be hydrophobic.

-Consensus pattern: D-x-[DNS]-{ILVFYW}-[DENSTG]-[DNQGHRK]-{GP}-[LIVMC]-
                    [DENQSTAGC]-x(2)-[DE]-[LIVMFYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for a few sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 52 proteins  which are probably not
 calcium-binding and  a  few proteins for which we have reason to believe that
 they bind  calcium:  a  number  of endoglucanases  and  a  xylanase  from the
 cellulosome complex of Clostridium [9].

-Note: positions 1 (X), 3 (Y) and 12 (-Z) are the most conserved.
-Note: the 6th residue in an EF-hand loop is, in most  cases a  Gly,  but  the
 number of exceptions to this 'rule' has gradually increased and we felt  that
 the pattern should include all the  different  residues which have been shown
 to exist in this position in functional Ca-binding sites.
-Note: the pattern will, in some cases,  miss  one  of  the EF-hand regions in
 some proteins with multiple EF-hand domains.

* Actinin-type actin-binding domain signatures *
************************************************

Alpha-actinin is  a F-actin cross-linking  protein  which is thought to anchor
actin to a variety of intracellular structures [1].   The actin-binding domain
of alpha-actinin seems to reside in the first  250 residues of the protein.  A
similar actin-binding domain has  been  found in the N-terminal region of many
different actin-binding proteins [2,3]:

 - In the beta chain of spectrin (or fodrin).
 - In dystrophin, the protein defective  in  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   and which  may  play a  role  in  anchoring the  cytoskeleton to the plasma
   membrane.
 - In the slime mold gelation factor (or ABP-120).
 - In actin-binding protein ABP-280  (or filamin), a  protein  that link actin
   filaments to membrane glycoproteins.
 - In fimbrin (or plastin),  an actin-bundling protein.  Fimbrin  differs from
   the above proteins in  that  it  contains  two  tandem copies of the actin-
   binding domain and that these copies are located  in the C-terminal part of
   the protein.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns for this type of
domain.  The first of this region  is located at  the beginning of the domain,
while the second one is  located in  the central section and has been shown to
be essential for the binding of actin.

Anaphylatoxins [1]  are  mediators  of  local inflammatory process that act by

C3a, C4a  and  C5a. They are peptides of about 75 amino-acid residues that are
derived from the proteolytic degradation of complement C3, C4 and C5 and which
contains six  disulfide-bonded cysteines [2] (see the schematic representation

* Ankyrin repeat and ankyrin repeat region profiles *
*****************************************************

Ankyrin repeats  (ANK)  are tandemly repeated modules of about 33 amino acids.
They occur  in  a  large  number  of functionally diverse proteins mainly from
eukaryotes. The  few  known  examples  from prokaryotes and viruses may be the
result of horizontal gene transfers [1].

Many ankyrin   repeat   regions  are  known  to  function  as  protein-protein
interaction domains.

The conserved  fold  of  the ankyrin repeat unit is known from several crystal
and solution structures, e.g. from:

 - p53-binding protein 53BP2 [2],
 - Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p19Ink4d [3],
 - Transcriptional regulator GABP-beta [4],
 - NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkB-alpha [5].

It has  been  described  as an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta-hairpin
and two alpha-helices [2].

Two profiles  were  developed  for  this  module,  the  first one picks up ANK
repeats while  the  second profile is 'circular' and will thus detect a region
containing adjacent ANK repeats.

Plasma kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.34) and  coagulation factor XI (EC 3.4.21.27) are
two related plasma serine proteases activated  by  factor XIIA and which share
the same  domain  topology:  an  N-terminal  region  that contains four tandem
repeats of about 90 amino acids and a C-terminal catalytic domain.

The 90 amino-acid repeated domain contains 6 conserved cysteines.  It has been
shown [1,2] that three  disulfide bonds  link the first and sixth,  second and
fifth, and third and fourth cysteines. The domain can be drawn in the shape of
an apple (see below) and has been accordingly called the 'apple domain'.

* Armadillo/plakoglobin ARM repeat profile *
********************************************

The armadillo repeat is an approximately 40 amino acids long tandemly repeated
sequence motif  first  identified  in  the  Drosophila  segment  polarity gene
product armadillo, a protein that mediates cell adhesion. Similar repeats were
later found  in  the  mammalian armadillo homolog beta-catenin, the junctional
plaque protein   plakoglobin,  the  adenomatous  polyposis  coli  (APC)  tumor
suppressor protein,  and  a number of other proteins [1]. These proteins exert
several functions  through  interactions  of  their  tandem  armadillo repeats
domain with diverse binding partners. The proteins combine structural roles as
cell-contact and  cytoskeleton-associated  proteins and signaling functions by
generating and transducing signals affecting gene expression [1,2,3].

The three-dimensional  fold  of  an armadillo repeat is known from the crystal
structure of  beta-catenin  [4].  There,  the  12 repeats form a superhelix of
alpha-helices, with three helices per unit. The cylindrical structure features
a positively charged grove which presumably interacts with the acidic surfaces
of the known interaction partners of beta-catenin.

* Band 4.1 family domain signatures and profile *
*************************************************

A number of  cytoskeletal-associated  proteins  that  associate  with  various
proteins at the  interface between the plasma membrane  and  the  cytoskeleton
contain a  conserved  N-terminal domain of about 150 amino-acid residues [1,2,
3]. The proteins in which such a domain is known to exist are listed below.

 - Band 4.1, which links  the spectrin-actin  cytoskeleton  of erythrocytes to
   the plasma membrane. Band 4.1 binds with a high affinity to glycophorin and
   with lower affinity to band 3 protein.
 - Ezrin (cytovillin or p81), a component  of  the undercoat of the microvilli
   plasma membrane.
 - Moesin, which is probably involved in binding major cytoskeletal structures
   to the plasma membrane.
 - Radixin, which seems to play a  crucial role in  the  binding of the barbed
   end of actin filaments to the plasma membrane in the undercoat of the cell-
   to-cell adherens junction (AJ).
 - Talin, which binds  with high affinity to vinculin and with low affinity to
   integrins.  Talin  is a high molecular weight (270 Kd) cytoskeletal protein
   concentrated in regions of cell-substratum  contact and, in lymphocytes, of
   cell-cell contacts.
 - Filopodin,  a  slime mold protein that binds actin ans which is involved in
   the control of cell motility and chemotaxis.
 - Merlin  (or  schwannomin).  Defects in this protein are the cause of type 2
   neurofibromatosis (NF2), a predisposition to tumors of the nervous system.
 - Protein NBL4.

 - Protein-tyrosine   phosphatases   PTPN3   (PTP-H1)  and  PTPN4  (PTP-MEG1).
   Structurally these two very similar  enzymes  are  composed of a N-terminal
   band 4.1-like domain followed by a central segment of  unknown function and
   a C-terminal   catalytic  domain  (see  <PDOC00323>).  They  could  act  at
   junctions between the membrane and the cytoskeleton.
 - Protein-tyrosine  phosphatases  PTPN14  (PEZ or PTP36) and PTP-D1, PTP-RL10
   and PTP2E.  These  phosphatases  also consist of a N-terminal band 4.1-like
   domain and  a  C-terminal  catalytic  domain.  The  central domain seems to
   contain a SH3-binding domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein phosphatase ptp-1.

Ezrin, moesin, and radixin are highly related proteins, but the other proteins
in which this domain is found do not share any region of similarity outside of
the domain.  In  band  4.1  this  domain  is  known  to  be  important for the
interaction with glycophorin, an integral membrane protein.

We have developed two signature  patterns for this domain, one is based on the
conserved positions  found  at  the  N-terminal  extremity  of the domain, the
second is located in the C-terminal section.

The BEACH  (BEIge  And  CHS)  domain  is a region of about 300 residues highly
conserved and  which  is  found  in  otherwise  distinct  proteins over a wide
species range  [1,2].  The function of the BEACH  domain is unknown. The BEACH
domain is usually followed by a series of WD repeats (see <PDOC00574>). 

Proteins known to contain a BEACH domain are listed below:

 - Human  lysosomal  trafficking  regulator  or Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS)
   protein. Defects  in  the  CHS  protein  are  the  cause of Chediak-Higashi
   Syndrome, a  rare  autosomal  disorder  characterized  by hypopigmentation,
   severe immunologic   deficiency,   a   bleeding   tendency  and  neurologic
   abnormalities. As an important hallmark of several tissues derived from CHS
   patients is  the  occurrence  of  giant inclusion bodies and organelles and
   protein sorting  defects in these organelles, the CHS protein is thought to
   be involved  in  vesicle  fusion or fission. The CHS protein contains 7 WD-
   repeats. The mouse ortholog of CHS is called 'beige'.
 - Mammalian FAN (Factor Associated with Neutral-sphingomyelinase activation).
   It binds to the N-SMase activation domain (NSD) of the p55 TNF-receptor and
   mediates the  activation of N-SMase after ligand binding. FAN contains five
   WD-repeats.

The BRCA2  repeat  [1] is a small domain (34 residues) currently found only in
the breast  cancer  susceptibility  gene protein 2 (BRCA2). These repeats were
shown  to be required for direct interaction with DNA repair protein RAD51 [2,
3,4]. BRCA2  was also shown to  functionally  interact  with p53 and RAD51 two
key components of the cell cycle control and DNA repair pathways [5]. As BRCA1
and BRCA2  display  a stable interaction  both  together  [6]  and  with RAD51
[2,3,4,5,7], they  may participate in a pathway associated with the activation
of double-strand break repair and/or homologous recombination.

* BRCT domain profile *
***********************

The breast cancer susceptibility gene contains at its C-terminus two copies of
a conserved  domain  that  was named BRCT for BRCA1 C-terminus. This domain of
about 95  amino acids is found in a large variety of proteins involved in DNA-
repair, recombination  and  cell cycle control [1,2,3]. The BRCT domain is not
limited to  the  C-termini  of  protein sequences and can be found in multiple
copies or  in  a single copy as in RAP1 and TdT. Recent data [4] indicate that
the BRCT domain functions as a protein-protein interaction module.

The structure of the first of the two C-terminal BRCT domains of the human DNA
repair protein  XRCC1  has  recently  been determined by X-ray crystallography
[4].

Some proteins known to contain a BRCT domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein. It may regulate gene
   expression.
 - Human P53-binding protein 1.
 - Human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (EC 2.4.2.30). It modifies various
   nuclear proteins by poly(ADP-rybosyl)ation.
 - Vertebrate nucleotidylexotransferase  (EC 2.7.7.31). It adds nucleotides at
   the junction  (N  region)  of rearranged Ig heavy chain and T cell receptor
   gene segments during the maturation of B and T cells.
 - Mammalian DNA-repair protein XRCC1.
 - Human  DNA  ligase  III  (EC  6.5.1.1).  It is involved in DNA strand-break
   repair.
 - Human DNA ligase IV (EC 6.5.1.1).
 - Drosophila germline transcription factor 1. A putative transcription factor
   active during oogenesis and embryogenesis.
 - Baker's yeast DNA ligase II (EC 6.5.1.1).
 - Baker's yeast RAD9 protein. It is essential for cell cycle arrest following
   DNA damage by X-irradiation or inactivation of DNA ligase.
 - Baker's yeast RAP1. It is involved in telomeric and HM loci silencing.
 - Escherichia  coli  DNA  ligase  (EC  6.5.1.2).  It  is  essential  for  DNA
   replication and repair of damaged DNA.
 - Synechocystis sp. DNA ligase (EC 6.5.1.2). It is probably essential for DNA
   replication and repair of damaged DNA.

* BTB domain profile *
**********************

The BTB domain (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) is also known as the
POZ domain  (POxvirus  and  Zinc  finger).  It  is  a  homodimerization domain
occurring at  the  N-terminus of proteins containing multiple copies of either
zinc fingers    of    the  C2H2 type (see <PDOC00028>) or Kelch repeats [1,2].
Many BTB  proteins  are  transcriptional  regulators  that  are thought to act
through the control of chromatin structure.

The structure  of  the  BTB  domain  of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger
(PLZF) protein  has  been  determined  by  X-ray crystallography and reveals a
tightly intertwined  dimer  with  an  extensive  hydrophobic  interface [3]. A
surface-exposed groove lined with conserved amino acids is formed at the dimer 
interface, suggesting a peptide-binding site.

Some proteins known to contain a BTB/TTK doamin are listed below:

 - Mammalian Bach proteins. These transcriptional regulators act as repressors
   or activators.
 - Mammalian B-cell lymphoma 6 protein (BCL-6). A transcriptional regulator.
 - Mammalian   calicin.   A   possible  morphogenic  cytoskeletal  element  in
   spermiogenic differenciation.
 - Human  promyelocytic  leukemia zinc finger (PLZF). A probable transcription
   factor.
 - Drosophila GAGA transcription factor.
 - Drosophila  Mod(MDG4)  or E(VAR)3-93D. A chromatin protein involved in gene
   silencing in  position  effect  variegation, the control of gypsy insulator
   sequence, maintenance of gene expression, and apoptosis.
 - Drosophila Tramtrack (TTK) protein. A probable transcriptional repressor.
 - Drosophila  Kelch  protein.  A  component of ring canals that regulates the
   flow of cytoplasm between cells.

************************
* C1q domain signature *
************************

C1q is  a subunit of the C1 enzyme complex that activates the serum complement
system.  It is composed of 9 disulfide-linked dimers of the chains A, B and C,
which share  a  common  structure  which  consist  of  a N-terminal nonhelical
region, a  triple  helical (collagenous) region and a C-terminal globular head
which is called the C1q domain. That domain consists of  about 136 amino acids
which probably form ten beta strands interspersed by  beta-turns  and/or loops
[1]. Such a domain has been found in the C-terminus of  vertebrate secreted or
membrane-bound proteins which are mostly short-chain  collagens and  collagen-
like molecules [1-4]. These proteins are listed below:

 - Complement  C1q subcomponent  chains A, B and C. Efficient activation of C1
   takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions
   of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.
 - Vertebrate short-chain  collagen  type  VIII,  the major  component  of the
   basement membrane  of corneal endothelial cells. It is composed of a triple
   helical domain  in  between  a  short  N-terminal and  a  larger C-terminal
   globule which contains the C1q domain.
 - Vertebrate collagen type X, which has the same structure than collagen type
   VIII. It is a product of hyperthrophic chondrotocytes.
 - Bluegill  inner-ear  specific structural protein. This short-chain collagen
   forms a microstructural matrix within the otolithic membrane.
 - Chipmunk hibernation-associated plasma  proteins  HP-20,  HP-25  and HP-27.
   These proteins disappear from blood  specifically during  hibernation. They
   contain a collagen-like  domain  near  the  N-terminus and a C-terminal C1q
   domain.
 - Human  precerebellin, which  is  located  within postsynaptic structures of
   Purkinje cells, probably membrane-bound. Cerebellin is involved in synaptic
   activity.
 - Rat precerebellin-like  glycoprotein, a probable membrane protein.  The C1q
   domain is located at the C-terminal extracellular extremity.
 - Human  endothelial  cell  multimerin  (ECM), a carrier protein for platelet
   factor V/VA.
 - Vertebrate  30 Kd adipocyte complement-related protein (ACRP30), also known
   as ApM1 or AdipoQ.

The C-terminal  globular  domain  of  the C1q subcomponents and collagen types
VIII and  X  is  important  both  for the correct folding and alignment of the
triple helix  and  for  protein-protein recognition events [5,6]. For collagen
type X  it  has been suggested that the domain is important for initiation and
maintenance of the correct assembly of the protein [7].

There are  two well conserved regions within the C1q domain: an aromatic motif
is located  within the first half of the domain, the other conserved region is
located near the C-terminal extremity. We  derived  the signature pattern from
the aromatic motif.

* CARD caspase recruitment domain profile *
*******************************************

The apoptotic  signal  coming  from  ligand-induced  oligomerization  of death
receptors is  mediated  by a number of adaptor proteins containing specialized
interaction domains. Besides the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), this group
is formed  by  the  death domain (DD) (see <PDOC50017>) and the death effector
domain (DED) (see <PDOC50168>).

The CARD  domain was first described as a homology region in the N-terminus of
the death  adaptor  protein  RAIDD  and  the  caspases  ced-3  and  CASP2 [1].
Recently, it  was  shown  that  this  domain  is  widespread  among  apoptotic
signaling molecules  and  a  function in caspase-recruitment has been proposed
[2]. The CARD domain typically associates with other CARD-containing proteins,
forming either dimers or trimers [1,2,3,4]. It has been predicted that CARD is
related in  structure  and  sequence to both DD and DED domains, which work in
similar pathways and show similar interaction properties [2].

Important members of the CARD family occur in the following proteins:

 - RAIDD death adaptor protein [1].
 - Caspases: Ced-3, CASP1, CASP2, CASP4, CASP5, CASP9 and CASP12.
 - Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins c-IAP1 and c-IAP2.

************************************
* Calponin homology domain profile *
************************************

A number  of  actin-binding  proteins,   including spectrin, alpha-actinin and
fimbrin, contain  a  250  amino  acid  stretch called the actin binding domain
(ABD). The  ABD has probably arisen from duplication of a domain which is also
found in  a single copy in a number of other proteins like calponin or the vav
proto-oncogene and has been called calponin homology (CH) domain [1,2].

A detailed  analysis  of The CH domain-containing proteins has shown that they
can be divided in three groups [1]:

 - The  fimbrin  family  of monomeric actin cross-linking molecules containing
   two ABDs
 - Dimeric  cross-linking  proteins  (alpha-actinin,  beta-spectrin,  filamin,
   etc.) and  monomeric  F-actin  binding proteins (dystrophin, utrophin) each
   containing one ABD  
 - Proteins containing only a single amino terminal CH domain.

Each single  ABD, comprising two CH domains, is able to bind one actin monomer
in the  filament.  The  amino  terminal CH domain has the intrinsic ability to
bind actin,  albeit  with  lower  affinity  than the complete ABD, whereas the
carboxy terminal  CH  bind  actin extremely weakly or not at all. Nevertheless
both CH  domains  are  required  for a fully functional ABD; the C-terminal CH
domain contributing  to  the  overall  stability  of  the complete ABD through
inter-domain helix-helix  interactions  [1]. Some of the proteins containing a
single CH  domain  also  bind to actin, although this has not been shown to be
via the  single CH domain alone [2]. In addition, the CH domain occurs also in
a number  of proteins not known to bind actin, a notable example being the vav
protooncogene.

The resolution  of  the  3D structure of various CH domains has shown that the
conserved core consist of four major alpha-helices [2].

Some proteins known to contain a CH-domain are listed below:

 - Alpha-actinins.  F-actin cross-linking proteins which are thought to anchor
   actin to a variety of intracellular structures.
 - Calponins (see <PDOC00808>).  Thin  filament-associated  proteins which are
   implicated in the regulation and modulation of smooth muscle contraction.
 - Human  dystrophin. This protein is defective in Duchenne muscular dystrophy
   and Becker  muscular  dystrophy.  It  may  play  a  role  in  anchoring the
   cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.
 - Mammalian  vav  proto-oncogene.  It could be an exchange factor for a small
   ras-like GTP-binding protein.
 - Human ras GTPase activating-like protein IQGAP1.
 - Spectrin  beta chain. Spectrin is the major constituent of the cytoskeletal
   network underlying the erythrocyte plasma membrane.
 - Transgelins.  There  are  actin  cross-linking/gelling proteins involved in
   calcium interactions  and  contractile  properties  of  the  cell  that may
   contribute to replicative senescence.
 - T-plastin,  an  actin-bundling protein found in intestinal microvilli, hair
   cell stereocilia, and fibroblast filopodia.
 - Drosophila  muscle-specific  protein  20.  It  might be the calcium-binding
   protein of synchronous muscle.
 - Yeast fimbrin. It binds to actin.
 - Slime mold gelation factor. It is a F-actin cross-linking protein.

* C-terminal cystine knot signature and profile *
*************************************************

The structures  of  transforming  growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta), nerve growth
factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and gonadotropin have been
shown to  be  similar  [1,2 and references therein]: these proteins are folded
into two  highly  twisted antiparallel pairs of beta-strands and contain three
disulfide bonds, of which two form a cystine ring through which the third bond
passes (see  the  schematic  representation  below).  This structure is called
cystine knot [3].

            |                 :
            +--<======b1======C--------------NH(2)

'=>': indicates the direction of the beta-strands 'b1' to 'b4'.
'C' : conserved cysteine in cystine knot.
'c' : additional conserved cysteine in C-terminal cystine knot.
':' : disulfide bridge.

Functional diverse modular proteins share a conserved domain of about 90 amino
acids in  their  C-terminal cysteine-rich region, that has been proposed [4,5]
to be  structurally  related  to  the  cystine-knot  family  [3]  and which is
therefore called  C-terminal  cystine-knot  (CTCK).  Members of the C-terminal
cystine knot family are listed below:

 - von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multifunctional protein which is involved in
   maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 vWF type D domains, 3 vWF type A
   domains, 3  vWF  type  B  domains, 2 vWF type C domains (see <PDOC00928>, a
   X domain and the C-terminal cystine knot.
 - Mucins.  Human  mucin  2, a highly polymorphic multidomain molecule with  a
   modular architecture  similar  to  vWF.  Xenopus mucin B.1 which contains a
   CCP domain, a vWF type C domain, a X domain and a CTCK. Other  mucins  that
   contain a  CTCK  are  the  human tracheobronchial mucin (gene MUC5), bovine
   submaxillary mucin-like protein, pig apomucin and rat intestinal mucin-like
   protein.
 - CCN  family  (cef-10/cyr61/CTFG/fisp-12/nov  protein family). These growth-
   factor inducible   proteins  are  structurally  related to the insulin-like
   growth factor binding proteins (see <PDOC00194>) and could also function as
   growth-factor binding proteins.
 - Drosophila slit protein which is essential for  development of midline glia
   and commissural axon pathways. It is composed of four leucine-rich repeats,
   seven EGF-like domains, a laminin G-like repeat and the CTCK.
 - Norrie disease protein (NDP) which may be involved in neuroectodermal cell-
   cell interaction   and   in   a   pathway   that   regulates   neural  cell
   differentiation and proliferation.
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
   lectin domain  (see  <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a
   CTCK.

The pattern  we  developed  for  CTCK correspond to the C-terminal half of the
domain.

**********************
* CUB domain profile *
**********************

The CUB  domain  [1,2,E1]  is  an  extracellular  domain  of approximately 110
residues which  is  found  in  functionally  diverse,  mostly  developmentally
regulated proteins.  Almost  all  CUB domains contain four conserved cysteines
which probably form two disulfide bridges (C1-C2, C3-C4). The structure of the
CUB domain  has  been  predicted  to  be  a  beta-barrel  similar  to  that of
immunoglobulins.

Proteins that have been found to contain the CUB domain are listed below.

 - Mammalian  complement  subcomponents  C1s/C1r.  C1q,  C1s  and C1r form the
   calcium-dependent complex C1, which is the first component of the classical
   pathway  of the  complement system.  Both proteins contain two CUB domains,
   an EGF-like domain, two CCP domains and a trypsin  family  serine  protease
   domain (see <PDOC00124>).
 - Hamster  serine protease  Casp. Casp is a heterodimer of a regulatory and a
   catalytic chain  which  degrades  type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in
   the presence  of  calcium.  It shows the same modular architecture than C1s
   and C1r.
 - Mammalian  complement-activating  component  of  Ra-reactive factor (RARF).
   This protein,  also  known  as  P100,  is  a  protease  that cleaves the C4
   component of  complement.  It  shows the same modular architecture than C1s
   and C1r.
 - Vertebrate    enteropeptidase  (EC 3.4.21.9), a type II membrane protein of
   the intestinal  brush  border,  which activates trypsinogen. It consists at
   least of  a catalytic light chain  and a multidomain  heavy chain which has
   2 LDL receptor-like domains, a MAM  domain (see <PDOC00604>), a SRCR domain
   and a CUB domain.
 - Vertebrate  bone  morphogenic  protein  1  (BMP-1), a protein which induces
   cartilage and  bone  formation  and  which  expresses  metalloendopeptidase
   activity. The  Drosophila homolog of BMP-1 is the dorsal-ventral patterning
   protein Tolloid, which is required for normal dorsal development. In purple
   sea urchin a homolog protein is called SuBMP. All these molecules possess a
   zinc-metalloprotease domain  (see  <PDOC00129>) and a varying number of CUB
   (up to 5 in mouse BMP-1 and Tolloid) and EGF-like domains.
 - Sea    urchins  blastula  proteins  BP10 and SpAN. Both proteins consist of
   2 CUB domains, an EGF-like domain and a zinc-metalloprotease domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  proteins  F42A10.8  and R151.5. Both
   proteins consist   of   a  CUB  domain,  a  EGF-like  domain  and  a  zinc-
   metalloprotease domain.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2 CUB domains,  2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>) and a MAM domain
   (see <PDOC00604>).
 - Fibropellins  I  and  III  from  sea urchin. These proteins form the apical
   lamina, a component of the extracellular matrix. These two proteins contain
   a CUB  domain,  followed  by a variable number of EGF-like domains and a C-
   terminal avidin-like domain (see <PDOC00499>).
 - Mammalian  hyaluronate-binding  protein  TSG-6 (or PS4), a serum and growth
   factor induced  protein  possibly  involved  in  cell-cell  and cell-matrix
   interactions during  inflammation and tumorgenesis. TSG-6 contains a 'link'
   domain followed by a CUB domain.
 - Mammalian spermadhesins (see <PDOC00758>) which consist of a CUB domain.
 - Xenopus  embryonic  protein UVS.2,  which is expressed during dorsoanterior
   development. It contains 2 CUB domains.

For the sensitive  detection of CUB domains, we have developed a profile which
spans the whole domain.

{PS50017; DEATH_DOMAIN}
{BEGIN}
************************
* Death domain profile *
************************

The death  domain  [1,2,3,E1] (FAS/TNF cytosolic interaction domain) has first
been described  as  a region in the cytoplasmic tail of the 75 Kd TNF receptor
(TNFR-1) (see  <PDOC00561>)  which  is  involved  in  TNF-mediated  cell death
signaling. A corresponding region is found in the cytoplasmic tail of FAS/APO1
another surface  receptor  inducing apoptotic cell death. This region mediates
self-association of  these  receptors,  thus  giving  the signal to downstream
events leading to apoptosis.

Subsequently, a number of other proteins have  been found to interact with the
cytoplasmic part of either FAS or the TNF receptor  in the region of the death
domain. Overexpression  of  these  proteins  usually  leads  to cell death. By
profile analysis, it has been shown that  a number  of  other proteins contain
regions with  significant  similarity  to  the  death  domain.  Interestingly,
several of these proteins also work in the context of cell death signaling.

The following proteins have been found to contain a death domain:

 - Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  type  I  (TNFR-1),  which  induces cell death upon
   binding of TNF.
 - FAS/APO1 receptor, which induces cell death upon binding of FAS-ligand.
 - Low-affinity  nerve  growth factor receptor (LA-NGFR), which is involved in
   inducing cell death, sensing the absence of it's ligand NGF.
 - Wsl-1, a receptor that mediates apoptosis.
 - MORT1/FADD, a human protein that binds to the death  domain of FAS/APO1 and
   induces apoptosis.
 - TRADD, a human protein that binds to TNFR-1, signaling cell death and NF-kB
   activation.
 - RIP,  a  human  protein that interacts with FAS/APO1 and weakly with TNFR-1
   and induces  cell  death.  Rip  contains  a protein kinase domain at its N-
   terminus.
 - All  known isoforms of ankyrin, this includes the ankyrin-like protein unc-
   44 from  Caenorhabditis  elegans.    Ankyrin is a protein that attaches the
   cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.
 - Human 'death associated protein kinase' (DAP-kinase), a  mediator of gamma-
   interferon induced cell death.
 - p84, a human protein that binds to the N-terminus of the Rb-protein.
 - MyD88,  a  mouse  macrophage  differentiation  marker  that also contains a
   TOLL/IL1R-domain.
 - Unc-5, a Caenorhabditis elegans receptor-type neuronal guidance protein.
 - Pelle,  a  protein  kinase  from  Drosophila  involved  in  the Toll/Dorsal
   signaling pathway.

 - Reaper,  a  cell  death  mediating  protein  from Drosophila, has also been
   reported [4] to contain a death domain. However, rigorous sequence analysis
   [2] does not statistically confirm the presence of such a domain.

In most  of  these  proteins,  the  death  domain is located at the extreme C-
terminus. Exceptions  are  ankyrin,  MyD88 and pelle, all protein probably not
directly involved in cell death signaling. In the case of ankyrin, the isoform
2.1 is a splice variant which has the death domain located at the C-terminus.

The profile  covers  the  complete  domain  up to the boundaries that define a
minimally functional  death  domain  in  FAS  and TNF-receptor. This region is
slightly bigger than the observed sequence conservation

* Death effector domain (DED) profile *
***************************************

The apoptotic  signal  coming  from  ligand-induced  oligomerization  of death
receptors is  mediated  by a number of adaptor proteins containing specialized
interaction domains.  Besides  the  death effector domain (DED), this group is
formed by  the death domain (DD) (see <PDOC50017>) and the caspase recruitment
domain (CARD) (see <PDOC50209>).

The death  effector  domain  was first described in the FADD/Mort1 protein [1]
and later  shown  to  also  occur  in  several  other  proteins [2,3]. The DED
typically associates with other DED-containing proteins, forming either dimers
or trimers [2,3,4]. It has been predicted that the DED is related in structure
and sequence  to  both DD and CARD domains, which work in similar pathways and
show similar  interaction  properties [5]. Important members of the DED family
are:

 - FADD/MORT1 death adaptor protein.
 - Caspase-8 (EC 3.4.22.-), upstream death protease, interacts with FADD.
 - Caspase-10 (EC 3.4.22.-).
 - v-FLIP, FLICE(caspase)-inhibitors that occur in gamma herpesviruses and the
   poxvirus MCV, interact with FADD and/or Caspase-8.
 - c-FLIP,  cellular  FLICE-inhibitor  with inactive caspase domain, interacts
   with FADD and/or caspase-8.

* DEP domain profile *
**********************

The DEP domain is a globular domain of about 80 residues that is found in more
than  50  proteins involved in G protein signaling pathways. It has been named
after the three proteins (Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin) in which it was
initially  identified [1]. It has been proposed that the DEP domain could play
a  selective  role  in  targeting  DEP  domain-containing proteins to specific
subcellular  membranous  sites,  perhaps  even  to  specific G protein-coupled
signaling pathways [2,3].

Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  has  revealed  that the DEP domain
comprises  a  three-helix  bundle,  a beta-hairpin 'arm' composed of two beta-
strands and two short beta-strands in the C-terminal region [3].

Representative example of proteins containing DEP domains are listed below:
                                                              
 - Drosophila  and  vertebrate dishevelled (Dsh and Dvl), proteins that play a
   key role  in the transduction of the Wg/Wnt signal from the cell surface to
   the nucleus.
 - Vertebrate   Pleckstrin,  the  major  substrate  of  protein  kinase  C  in
   platelets. Pleckstrin  contains  two  PH domains (see <PDOC50003>) flanking
   the DEP domain.
 - Mammalian  regulator  of  G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins 6, 7, 9 and 11
   (see <PDOC50132>).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  Egl-10,  which  regulates  G  protein signaling in
   nervous system.

The profile we developed covers the entire DEP domain.

********************************************
* Disintegrin domain signature and profile *
********************************************

Disintegrins [1,2]  are  snake  venom   proteins   which  inhibit   fibrinogen
interaction  with  platelet  receptors  expressed on the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa
complex. They act by binding to the integrin glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor on
the  platelet  surface and  inhibit  aggregation  induced  by  ADP,  thrombin,
platelet-activating factor and collagen.

Disintegrins are peptides of about  70 amino  acid residues that contain  many
cysteines all  involved  in disulfide bonds [3].  Disintegrins contain an Arg-
Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, a recognition site of many adhesion proteins.  The RGD
sequence  of disintegrins is postulated to interact with the glycoprotein IIb-
IIIa complex.

The sequences of disintegrins from  different  snake  species are known. These
proteins  are  known  as:  albolabrin,   applagin,  barbourin,  batroxostatin,
bitistatin, echistatin, elegantin, eristicophin, flavoridin, halysin, kistrin,
tergeminin and triflavin.

Some other proteins are known to contain a disintegrin domain:

 - Some  snake    venom  zinc metalloproteinases [4]  consist of an N-terminal
   catalytic domain  fused  to  a  disintegrin  domain.  Such  is the case for
   trimerelysin I    (HR1B),   atrolysin e (Ht-e)  and  trigramin. It has been
   suggested  that  these proteinases  are  able to cleave themselves from the
   disintegrin domains  and  that  the  latter  may  arise  from  such a post-
   translational processing.
 - ADAM type metalloproteases (see <PDOC50215>).
 - Mammalian epididymial protein 1 (EAP I) [6].  EAP I is  associated with the
   sperm membrane and may play a role in sperm maturation. Structurally, EAP I
   consists of  an  N-terminal  domain,  followed  by a zinc metalloproteinase
   domain, a disintegrin domain, and a large C-terminal domain that contains a
   transmembrane region.

The schematic  representation of the structure of a typical disintegrin domain
is shown below:

                                   +---+

X-linked lissencephaly   is  a  severe  brain  malformation  affecting  males.
Recently it  has been demonstrated that the doublecortin gene is implicated in
this disorder   [1].  Doublecortin  was  found  to  bind  to  the  microtubule
cytoskeleton. In  vivo  and  in vitro assays show that Doublecortin stabilizes
microtubules and  causes bundling [2]. Doublecortin is a basic protein with an
iso-electric point  of  10,  typical of microtubule-binding proteins. However,
its sequence contains no known microtubule-binding domain(s).

The detailed  sequence analysis of Doublecortin and Doublecortin-like proteins
allowed the  identification  of  an evolutionarily conserved Doublecortin (DC)
domain. This domain is found in the N-terminus of proteins and consists of one
or two tandemly repeated copies of an around 80 amino acids region [3]. It has
been suggested  that  the  first DC domain of Doublecortin  binds  tubulin and
enhances microtubule polymerization [3].

Some proteins known to contain a DC domain are listed below:

 - Doublecortin.  It is required for neuronal migration [1]. A large number of
   point mutations  in the human DCX gene leading to lissencephaly are located
   within the DC domains [3].
 - Human serine/threonine-protein kinase DCAMKL1. It is a probable kinase that
   may be   involved   in  a  calcium-signaling  pathway  controling  neuronal
   migration in the developing brain [4].
 - Retinitis pigmentosa 1 protein. It could play a role in the differentiation
   of photoreceptor  cells.  Mutation  in  the  human RP1 gene cause retinitis
   pigmentosa of type 1 [5].

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

The functional  significance  of  EGF  domains  in what appear to be unrelated
proteins is not yet clear. However, a common feature is that these repeats are
found in the extracellular  domain  of membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins
known to  be  secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF domain
includes six  cysteine  residues which have been shown (in EGF) to be involved
in disulfide  bonds.  The main structure is a two-stranded beta-sheet followed
by a  loop  to  a  C-terminal short two-stranded sheet. Subdomains between the
conserved cysteines  strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following
schematic representation of the EGF-like domain:

The region between the 5th and 6th cysteine contains two conserved glycines of
which at  least  one  is  present  in  most  EGF-like  domains. We created two

glycine residues.

* Calcium-binding EGF-like domain signature *
*********************************************

A sequence  of  about  forty amino-acid residues long found in the sequence of
epidermal growth  factor  (EGF)  has been shown [1-6] to be present in a large
number of  membrane-bound  and  extracellular,  mostly  animal  proteins  (see
<PDOC00021>). Many  of  these  proteins  require  calcium for their biological
function and  a  calcium-binding  site  has  been  found  to be located at the
N-terminus of  some  EGF-like  domains [8]. Calcium-binding may be crucial for
numerous protein-protein  interactions.  Proteins that are  known  or that are
predicted to contain calcium-binding EGF-like domains are listed below.

 - Bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP-1), a  protein which induces cartilage  and
   bone formation  and  which  expresses  metalloendopeptidase  activity  (1-2
   copies). Homologous proteins are found in sea urchin - suBMP (1 copy) - and
   in Drosophila - the dorsal-ventral patterning protein tolloid (2 copies).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  developmental proteins lin-12 (2 out of 13 copies)
   and glp-1 (10 copies).
 - Calcium-dependent serine proteinase (CASP) which degrades the extracellular
   matrix proteins type I and IV collagen and fibronectin (1 copy).
 - Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein COMP (2 out of 4 copies).
 - Coagulation factors VII, IX, and X (1 out of 2 copies).
 - Complement C1r components (1 copy).
 - Complement C1s components (1 copy).
 - Complement-activating component of Ra-reactive factor (RARF) (1 copy).
 - Crumbs,  an  epithelial  development  protein from Drosophila (12 out of 29
   copies).
 - Epidermal growth factor precursor (3 out of 9 copies).
 - Fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2 (43 out of 47 copies).
 - Fibropellins  IA  (8 out of 21 copies) and III (6 out of 8 copies) from the
   apical lamina - a component of the  extracellular matrix - of sea urchin.
 - Fibulin-1  (8  out  of  9  copies)  and  fibulin-2 (9-10 out of 10-11), two
   extracellular matrix proteins.
 - Leucocyte antigen CD97 (2 out of 3 copies), cell surface  glycoprotein EMR1
   (5 out of 6 copies) and cell surface glycoprotein F4/80 (6 out 7 copies).
 - LDL  receptors, which bind and transport low-density lipoproteins (1 out of
   3 copies).
 - Neurogenic  proteins  Notch  (21-22 out of 36), Xotch (21 out of 36), Motch
   (16 out  of 34) and the human homolog Tan-1 (18 out of 36), Delta (2 out of
   9 copies),  Drosophila  Serrate  (5  out of 14 copies) and Slit (2 out of 7
   copies).
 - Nidogen (also called entactin), a basement membrane protein from sea squirt
   (0 out of 2) and mammals (2 out of 6).
 - Proteoglycans  versican  (1  out  of  2  copies)  and  chondroitin  sulfate
   proteoglycan (gene PG-M) (1 out of 2 copies).
 - S1-5,  a  human  extracellular  protein whose ultimate activity is probably
   modulated by the environment (5 copies).
 - Thrombomodulin   (fetomodulin),  which  together  with  thrombin  activates
   protein C (2 out of 6 copies).
 - Thrombospondins  1 and 2  (1 out of 3 copies), 3 and 4 (2 out of 4 copies),
   adhesive  glycoproteins  that mediate   cell-to-cell   and   cell-to-matrix
   interactions.
 - Thyroid peroxidase 1 (EC 1.11.1.8) (1 copy).
 - Transforming  growth  factor  beta-1 binding protein (TGF-B1-BP) (14 out of
   16 or 18 copies).
 - Uromodulin (Tamm-horsfall urinary glycoprotein) (THP) (2 out of 3 copies).
 - Vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein S (3 out of 4 copies).
 - 63 Kd sperm flagellar membrane protein from sea urchin (1 out of 3 copies).
 - 93 Kd protein (gene nel) from chicken (2 out of 5 copies).
 - Hypothetical   337.6  Kd  protein  T20G5.3  from  Caenorhabditis elegans (1
   out of 44 copies).

For human coagulation factor IX it has been shown [7] that the calcium-ligands
form a pentagonal bipyramid.  The first, third and fourth conserved negatively
charged or   polar  residues  are  side  chain  ligands.  Latter  is  possibly
hydroxylated (see  <PDOC00010>)  [8].  A conserved aromatic residue as well as
the second   conserved   negative  residue  are  thought  to  be  involved  in
stabilizing the calcium-binding site.

Like in non-calcium binding EGF-like domains there are six conserved cysteines
and the  structure  of  both  types is very similar as calcium-binding induces
only strictly local structural changes [8].

***********************************************
* Laminin-type EGF-like (LE) domain signature *
***********************************************

Laminins [1]  are  the  major  noncollagenous components of basement membranes
that mediate  cell  adhesion,  growth migration, and differentiation. They are
composed of  distinct  but  related  alpha,  beta  and gamma chains. The three
chains form a cross-shaped molecule that consist of a long arm and three short
globular arms.  The long arm consist of a coiled coil structure contributed by
all three chains and cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds.

Beside different types of globular domains each subunit contains, in its first
half, consecutive repeats of about 60 amino acids in length that include eight
conserved cysteines  [2].    The  tertiary  structure  [3,4] of this domain is
remotely similar  in  its  N-terminal  to  that  of  the  EGF-like module (see
<PDOC00021>). It  is  known  as a 'LE' or 'laminin-type EGF-like' domain.  The
number of copies of the LE domain in the different forms of laminins is highly
variable; from 3 up to 22 copies have been found.

A schematic  representation  of  the  topology  of the four disulfide bonds in
the LE domain is shown below.

'*': position of the pattern

In additions to laminins, the LE domain is also found in:

 - Agrin, a basal lamina protein  that causes the aggregation of acetylcholine
   receptors on cultured muscle fibers. It consists of 9 Kazal-like domains, 2
   LE domains, and 4 EGF-like domains.
 - Perlecan,  a  multidomain  basement  membrane  heparan sulfate proteoglycan
   composed of  4  LDLRA  domains,  3  LamB  domains, 12 LE domains, 14-21 IG-
   like domains, 3 LamG domains, and 4 EGF-like domains.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  basement membrane proteoglycan UNC-52, which seems
   to be involved in myofilament assembly and/or attachment of the myofilament
   lattice to  the  cell membrane. The modular architecture is similar to that
   of perlecan;  it  consists of 3 LDLRA domains, 2 LamB domains, 7 LE domains
   and 16 IG-like domains.
 - Netrins,  proteins  that  control  guidance of CNS commissural axons at the
   midline and    peripheral  motor  axons. An homolog of netrin is UNC-6 from
   Caenorhabditis  elegans,  a  component  of an extracellular matrix cue that
   guides  dorso-ventral  migrations  on the epidermis. UNC-6 is required  for
   the guidance  of  pioneer  axons  and  migrating cells along the body wall.
   Netrins and UNC-6 are composed of a  laminin N-terminal domain (domain VI),
   3 LE domains and a complement C3/4/5 C-terminal domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  proteins  C54D1.5 and K08C7.3, which

located on   the  surface  within  the  loops  C1-C3  and  C5-C6  [3,4].  Long
consecutive arrays of LE domains in laminins form rod-like elements of limited
flexibility [1],  which  determine  the  spacing  in  the formation of laminin
networks of basement membranes [6,7].

We derived   a signature pattern for the LE domain which covers the C-terminal
half of the repeat starting with the fourth conserved cysteine.

* Coagulation factors 5/8 type C domain (FA58C) signatures *
************************************************************

Blood coagulation  factors  V  and  VIII contain a C-terminal, twice repeated,
domain of about 150 amino acids, which is called F5/8 type C, FA58C, or C1/C2-
like domain.  In  the  slime  mold  cell adhesion protein discoidin, a related
domain, named discoidin I-like domain, DLD, or DS, has been found which shares
a common C-terminal region of about 110 amino acids with the FA58C domain, but
whose N-terminal  40 amino acids are much less conserved. Similar domains have
been detected  in  other  extracellular  and membrane proteins [1-3] which are
listed below:

 - Mammalian  milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFGM), which is expressed in milk
   and sperm.  It  is probably involved in phospholipid-binding. It contains 2
   EGF-like repeats followed by 2 copies of FA58C.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2   CUB domains (see <PDOC00908>, 2 FA58C domains and a MAM domain
   (see <PDOC00604>).
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed of 2 FA58C domains, a C-type lectin domain (see
   <PDOC00537>), 2 VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928) and a CTCK (see <PDOC00912>).
 - Human  AEBP1,  a  transcriptional repressor  with carboxypeptidase activity
   that is  probably  involved  in  the  regulation  of the differentiation of
   osteoblasts. AEBP1  contains a single copy of FA58C. Mouse AEBP1 is shorter
   in its N-terminal and lacks part of the FA58C domain.
 - Bovine  Sco-spondin,  which  is  secreted  by  the  subcommissural organ in
   embryos and  is  involved  in  the  modulation  of neuronal aggregation. It
   contains at least 2 EGF-like domains, one FA58C, and 3 LDLRA domains.
 - Drosophila  neurexin  IV  which is required for septate junction and blood-
   nerve barrier  formation  and function. In comparision to neurexins I-alpha
   and III-alpha, which are composed of 6 LamG domains and 3 EGF-like repeats,
   the N-terminal LamG has been substituted by a FA58C domain in neurexin IV.
 - Mammalian  contactin  associated  proteins (CASPR), which are implicated in
   protein-protein interactions.
 - Mammalian  tyrosine-protein  kinase  receptors EDDR1 (CAK, DDR1, TRKE, etc)
   and NTRK3 (TKT or TYRO10) which all contain one copy of the FA58C domain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative tyrosine-protein kinases G01D9.2, F11D5.3
   and C25F6.4.

In coagulation  factors  V  and  VIII the  repeated  domains compose part of a
larger functional  domain  which  promotes binding to anionic phospholipids on
the surface  of  platelets and endothelial cells [4]. The C-terminal domain of
the second   FA58C repeat (C2) of coagulation factor VIII has been shown to be
responsible for  phosphatidylserine-binding  and essential for activity [5,6].
It forms an amphipathic alpha-helix, which binds to the membrane [7].

FA58C contains  two  conserved  cysteines  in  most  proteins,  which link the
extremities of    the  domain  by a disulfide bond [8-10]. A further disulfide
bond is located near the C-terminal of the second FA58C domain in MFGM [10].

* F-box domain profile *
************************

First identified in cyclin-F as a protein-protein interaction motif, the F-box
is a  conserved  domain  that  is present in numerous protein with a bipartite
structure [1].  Through  the  F-box,  these  proteins  are  linked to the Skp1
protein and  the  core  of  SCFs (Skp1-cullin-F-box protein ligase) complexes.
SCFs complexes  constitute  a  new  class  of E3 ligases [2]. They function in
combination with   the  E2  enzyme  Cdc34  to  ubiquitinate  G1  cyclins,  Cdk
inhibitors and  many other proteins, to mark them for degradation. The binding
of the specific substrates by SCFs complexes is mediated by divergent protein-
protein interaction  motifs  present in F-box proteins, like WD40 repeats (see
<PDOC00574>), leucine rich repeats [3,4] or ANK repeats (see <PDOC50088>).

Some proteins known to contain a F-box are listed below:

 - Mammalian G2/mitotic-specific cyclin-F.
 - Yeast CDC4. It contains WD repeats.
 - Yeast GRR1. It contains a leucine-rich segment.
 - Yeast MET30. It contains WD repeats.
 - Neurospora crassa Scon2. It contains WD repeats.
 - Emericella nidulans SconB. It contains WD repeats.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans Sel-10. It contains WD repeats.
 - Xenopus laevis beta-TrCP. It contains WD repeats.
 - Poxviruses protein B18. They contain ANK repeats.

* Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain profile *
********************************************

The forkhead-associated  (FHA) domain [1,E1] is  a putative nuclear signalling
domain found  in  a  variety  of  otherwise unrelated proteins. The FHA domain
comprise approximately  55  to  75  amino  acids  and  contains  three  highly
conserved blocks separated by divergent spacer regions. Currently  it has been
found in the following proteins:

 - Four  transcription factors that also contain a forkhead (FH) domain: mouse
   myocyte nuclear  factor  1  (MNF1),  yeast transcription factor FHL1, which
   probably controls  pre-mRNA  processing, and  yeast FKH1 and FKH2. In those
   protein the FHA domain is located N-terminal of the DNA-binding FH domain.
 - Kinase-associated protein  phosphatase  (KAPP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, a
   protein which specifically interacts with the receptor-type  Ser/Thr-kinase
   RLK5. In  KAPP,  the  FHA domain  maps  to a region that interacts with the
   receptor-type protein  kinase  RLK5 only if the kinase is phosphorylated on
   serine residues [2].
 - Two  protein  kinases from yeast that are involved in mediating the nuclear
   response to  DNA  damage:  DUN1  and  SPK1/SAD1 [3]. The latter is the only
   known protein containing two copies of the FHA domain.
 - Protein  kinase  cds1 from fission yeast contains a FHA domain and might be
   the ortholog of SPK1.
 - Protein kinase MEK1 from yeast, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Human nuclear antigen Ki67 which is expressed only in proliferating cells.

 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR115c, which contains a RING-finger C-terminal
   of the FHA domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins L8083.1 and 9346.10, which contain an extensive
   coiled-coil region C-terminal of the FHA domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK632.2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C01G6.5.

 - FraH  from  the  prokaryote Anabaena, which contains a zinc-finger motif N-
   terminal of the FHA domain.
 - An  ORF from the bacterium Streptomyces, which is on the opposite strand of
   the protein kinase pks1, overlapping the ORF of the kinase.

The profile we developed for the FHA domain covers the total domain.

* Fibrinogen beta and gamma chains C-terminal domain signature *
****************************************************************

Fibrinogen [1], the  principal protein of  vertebrate  blood  clotting  is  an
hexamer containing two  sets  of  three  different  chains  (alpha,  beta, and
gamma), linked to  each  other by  disulfide bonds. The N-terminal sections of
these three chains are  evolutionary  related  and  contain the cysteines that
participate in   the  cross-linking  of  the  chains.  However,  there  is  no
similarity between the C-terminal part of the alpha chain and that of the beta
and gamma chains.  The C-terminal  part of the beta and gamma  chains  forms a
domain of   about   270   amino-acid  residues.  As  shown  in  the  schematic
representation this domain contains four  conserved  cysteines involved in two
disulfide bonds.

Such a domain has been recently found [2,3] in other proteins which are listed

 - In the C-terminus  of mammalian Tenascin-X, an extracellular matrix protein
   that seems to be involved in cell adhesion.
 - In the C-terminus of mammalian prothrombinase.

The function of this domain  is  not  yet known, but it has been suggested [2]
that it could be  involved  in protein-protein interactions.  As  a  signature

* Type I fibronectin domain *
*****************************

Fibronectin is a plasma protein that binds cell surfaces and various compounds
including collagen, fibrin, heparin, DNA, and  actin.   The major part  of the
sequence of fibronectin consists  of the repetition of three types of domains,
which are called type I, II, and III [1]. Type I domain (FN1) is approximately
40 residues  in  length.    Four conserved cysteines are involved in disulfide
bonds. Fibronectin contains 12 repeats of this domain.  FN1 is also found as a
single copy in the following mammalian proteins:

 - Blood  coagulation factor  XII  (Hageman  factor),  which  is composed of a
   fibronectin type-II domain, two EGF-repeats, one fibronectin type-I domain,
   followed by a kringle.
 - Hepatocyte   growth   factor   (HGF)  activator  (EC  3.4.21.-),  activates
   hepatocyte growth  factor    by  converting  it  from  a  single chain to a
   heterodimeric form.  It  has  the  same modular architecture than the blood
   coagulation factor XII.
 - Tissue-type  plasminogen  activator  (t-PA),  which  contains a fibronectin
   type-I domain, one EGF-repeat, and two kringles.

The 3D structure  of the FN1 domain has been determined [2-5].  It consists of
two antiparallel beta-sheets, first a double-stranded one, that is linked by a
disulfide bond to a triple-stranded beta-sheet. The second conserved disulfide
bridge links the C-terminal adjacent strands of the domain  (see the schematic
representation below).

In human tissue plasminogen activator chain A the FN1 domain together with the

form a  single  structural and functional unit [4]. The two domains keep their
specific tertiary  structure,  but  interact  intimately to bury a hydrophobic
core;  the inter-module  linker  makes up the third strand of the EGF-module's
major beta-sheet.

We  developed a pattern, that spans  the domain between the first and the last

Fibronectin is a plasma protein that binds cell surfaces and various compounds
including collagen, fibrin, heparin, DNA, and  actin.   The major part  of the
sequence of fibronectin consists  of the repetition of three types of domains,
which are called  type I, II, and  III [1].   Type II  domain is approximately
forty residues long, contains  four  conserved cysteines involved in disulfide
bonds and  is   part  of  the  collagen-binding   region  of  fibronectin.  In
fibronectin  the  type II domain is duplicated. Type II domains have also been
found in the following proteins:

 - Blood coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor) (1 copy).
 - Bovine seminal plasma proteins PDC-109 (BSP-A1/A2) and BSP-A3 [2] (twice).
 - Cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (which is also the insulin-
   like growth factor II receptor) [3] (1 copy).
 - Mannose receptor of macrophages [4] (1 copy).
 - 180 Kd secretory phospholipase A2 receptor (1 copy) [5].
 - DEC-205 receptor (1 copy) [6].

* GTPase binding domain (GBD) profile *
***************************************

Many putative  downstream effectors of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac contain
a GTPase binding domain (GBD), also called p21 binding domain (PBD), which has
been shown  to  specifically  bind  the GTP bound form of Cdc42 or Rac, with a
preference for  Cdc42  [1,2].  The most conserved region of GBD/PBD domains is
the N-terminal  Cdc42/Rac  interactive binding motif (CRIB), which consists of
about 16  amino acids with the consensus sequence I-S-X-P-X(2,4)-F-X-H-X(2)-H-
V-G [3].  Although  the  CRIB  motif is necessary for the binding to Cdc42 and
Rac, it  is  not  sufficient  to give high-affinity binding [4,5]. A less well
conserved inhibitory  switch  (IS)  domain  responsible  for  maintaining  the
proteins in  a basal (autoinhibited) state is located C-terminaly of the CRIB-
motif [6,7,8].

GBD domains  can  adopt  related  but  distinct  folds  depending  on context.
Although GBD  domains  are  largely  unstructured  in  the  free state, the IS
domain forms   an   N-terminal  beta  hairpin  that  immediately  follows  the
conserved CRIB  motif  and  a  central  bundle  of  three alpha helices in the
autoinhibited state.  The interaction between GBD domains and their respective
G proteins  leads  to  the  formation  of  a  high-affinity  complex  in which
unstructured regions  of  both  the  effector  and the G protein become rigid.
CRIB motifs  from various GBD domains interact with Cdc42 in a similar manner,
forming an  intermolecular beta-sheet with strand beta-2 of Cdc42. Outside the
CRIB motif,  the  C-termini  of the various GBD domains are very divergent and
show variation  in  their  mode  of  binding to Cdc42, perhaps determining the
specificity of  the  interaction.  Binding  of  Cdc42 or Rac to the GBD domain
causes a  dramatic  conformational change, refolding part of the IS domain and
unfolding the rest [4,6,7,8,9,10]. 

Proteins known to contain a GBD domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  activated  Cdc42-associated kinases (ACKs), nonreceptor tyrosine
   kinases implicated in integrin-coupled pathways. 
 - Mammalian  p21-activated  kinases  (PAK1 to PAK4), serine/threonine kinases
   that modulate cytoskeletal assembly and activate MAP-kinase pathways.
 - Mammalian  Wiskott-Aldrich  Symdrom  Proteins  (WASPs), non-kinase proteins
   involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.
 - Yeast  STE20  and CLA4, the homologues of mammalian PAKs. STE20 is involved
   in the mating/pheromone MAP kinase cascade.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: this  profiles  covers  the  CRIB  motif  and  extends in the less-well
 conserved C-terminal  IS  domain. Whereas the CRIB motif is found in PAKs1-4,
 WASPs and  ACKs, the IS domain is replaced by a proline-rich sequence in ACKs
 and largely missing in PAK4 [8].

* HECT domain profile *
***********************

The HECT  (Homologous  to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) domain is an around 350
amino acids  motif  that  has been identified in proteins that all belong to a
particular E3  ubiquitin-protein  ligase  family  [1].  HECT domain containing
proteins accept ubiquitin  from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form
of a  thioester and then transfer it to target proteins. The site of ubiquitin
thioester formation  is a conserved cysteine residue located in the last 32-36
aa of the HECT domain [1]. The amino-terminal part of the HECT domain has been
involved in  E2 binding [2]. Once linked to ubiquitin, the target proteins are
degraded in the 26 S proteasome.

Some proteins known to contain a HECT domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian  E6-AP  (EC  6.3.2.-).  It  interacts  with the E6 protein of the
   cancer-associated human papillomavirus types16 and 18. The E6/E6-AP complex
   binds to  and  targets  the  p53  tumor-suppressor  protein  for  ubiquitin
   mediated proteolysis.
 - Yeast  RSP5 (EC 6.3.2.-). It is involved in the degradation of several cell
   surface proteins.
 - S.pombe pub1 (EC 6.3.2.-). It regulates ubiquitination of cdc25.
 - Yeast HUL4 and HUL5 (EC 6.3.2.-).
 - Drosophila  hyperplastic  discs  (HYD) protein (EC 6.3.2.-). It is required
   for regulation of cell proliferation in imaginal discs and germ cells.
 - Mammalian  NEDD4  (EC 6.3.2.-). It is involved in the embryonic development
   and differentiation of the central nervous system.
 - Rat  100  kDa  protein  (EC  6.3.2.-).  This  protein  may  be  involved in
   maturation and/or post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA.
 - Rat  UreB1. It contains only a portion of the HECT domain (310 aa), without
   any amino-terminal  extension.  It  could  be a DNA-binding transcriptional
   regulator.

* Hemopexin domain signature *
******************************

Hemopexin is a  serum glycoprotein that  binds  heme and transports it  to the
liver for breakdown and iron recovery, after  which the free hemopexin returns
to the circulation.  Structurally hemopexin consists of  two similar halves of
approximately two hundred  amino acid residues  connected  by a histidine-rich
hinge region. Each half is itself formed by the repetition of  a basic unit of
some 35 to 45 residues.  Hemopexin-like domains have  been found [1,2]  in two
other types of proteins:

 - In vitronectin, a cell  adhesion and spreading  factor  found in plasma and
   tissues. Vitronectin, like hemopexin, has two hemopexin-like domains.
 - In  most  members  of the matrix metalloproteinases family (matrixins) (see
   <PDOC00129>): MMP-1,  MMP-2,  MMP-3,  MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-11, MMP-12,
   MMP-13, MMP-14,  MMP-15,  MMP-16,  MMP-17,  MMP-18, MMP-19, MMP-20, MMP-24,
   and MMP-25. These zinc endoproteases have a single hemopexin-like domain in
   their C-terminal section.

It is suggested that the  hemopexin domain facilitates binding to a variety of
molecules and proteins. The signature pattern for this type of domain has been
derived from the best  conserved region  which is  located at the beginning of
the second repeat.

********************

The IQ motif  is  an  extremely  basic  unit  of  about 23 amino acids,  whose
conserved core usually fits the consensus A-x(3)-I-Q-x(2)-F-R-x(4)-K-K. The IQ 
motif, which  can  be  present in one or more copies, serves as a binding site
for different  EF-hand proteins (see <PDOC00018>) including the  essential and
regulatory myosin light chains, calmodulin (CaM), and CaM-like proteins [1,2].
Many IQ motis are protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites [3,4].

Resolution  of the 3D structure of scallop myosin has shown that the IQ motif
forms a basic amphipathic helix [5].

Some proteins known to contain an IQ motif are listed below:

 - A number of conventional and unconventional myosins.
 - Neuromodulin  (GAP-43)  (see  <PDOC00344>). This protein is associated with
   nerve growth.    It  is a major component of the motile "growth cones" that
   form the tips of elongating axons. 
 - Neurogranin  (NG/p17).  Acts  as  a  "third messenger" substrate of protein
   kinase C-mediated   molecular  cascades  during  synaptic  development  and
   remodeling.
 - Sperm surface protein Sp17.
 - Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1. IQGAP1 contains 4 IQ motifs.

The profile we developed covers the entire IQ motif.

*************************************************************
* LDL-receptor class A (LDLRA) domain signature and profile *
*************************************************************

Low-density lipoprotein  (LDL)  receptors  are the major  cholesterol-carrying
lipoproteins of  plasma.  Seven  successive  cysteine-rich repeats of about 40
amino acids are present in the N-terminal of this multidomain membrane protein
[1]. Similar  domains  have  been  found  (see  references  in  [2])  in other
extracellular and membrane proteins which are listed below:

 - Vertebrate  very low  density  lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, which binds and
   transports VLDL.   Its extracellular domain is composed of 8 LDLRA domains,
   3 EGF-like domains and 6 LDL-receptor class B domains (LDLRB).
 - Vertebrate  low-density   lipoprotein  receptor-related  protein  1  (LRP1)
   (reviewed in [3]),  which  may  act  as  a  receptor for the endocytosis of
   extracellular ligands. LRP1  contains  31  LDLRA  domains  and  22 EGF-like
   domains.
 - Vertebrate  low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2) (also
   known as  gp330 or megalin). LRP2 contains 36 LDLRA domains and 17 EGF-like
   domains.
 - A  LRP-homolog from Caenorhabditis elegans, which contains 35 LDLRA domains
   and 17 EGF-like domains.
 - Drosophila  putative vitellogenin receptor, with 13 copies of LDLRA domains
   and 17 EGF-like repeats.
 - Complement factor  I, which is responsible for cleaving the alpha-chains of
   C4b and C3b. It consists of a FIMAC domain (Factor I/MAC proteins C6/C7), a
   scavenger receptor-like domain,  2  copies of LDLRA and a C-terminal serine
   protease domain.
 - Complement  components  C6,  C7,  C8  and  C9.  They contain each one LDLRA
   domain.
 - Perlecan,   a   large   multidomain   basement   membrane  heparan  sulfate
   proteoglycan composed  of  4 LDLRA domains, 3 LamB domains, 12 laminin EGF-
   like domains,  14-21  IG-like  domains,  3  LamG  domains,  and  4 EGF-like
   domains. A   similar   but   shorter   proteoglycan  (UNC52)  is  found  in
   Caenorhabditis elegans which has 3 repeats of LDLRA.
 - Invertebrate  giant  extracellular  hemoglobin  linker  chains, which allow
   heme-containing chains to construct giant hemoglobin (1 LDLRA domain).
 - G-protein  coupled  receptor  Grl101  of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, which
   might directly transduce signals carried by large extracellular proteins.
 - Vertebrate  enterokinase  (EC  3.4.21.9), a type II membrane protein of the
   intestinal brush  border, which activates trypsinogen. It consists at least
   of a catalytic light chain and a multidomain heavy chain which has 2 LDLRA,
   a MAM  domain  (see <PDOC00604>),  a  SRCR  domain  and  a  CUB domain (see
   <PDOC00908>).
 - Human  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease protein 1 (PKD1), which
   is involved    in   adhesive   protein-protein   and   protein-carbohydrate
   interactions. The potential calcium-binding site of its single LDLRA domain
   is missing.
 - Vertebrate    integral   membrane   protein DGCR2/IDD, a potential adhesion
   receptor with  1 LDLRA  domain,  a  C-type  lectin  and  a VWFC domain (see
   <PDOC00928>).
 - Drosophila  serine protease  nudel  (EC 3.4.21.-), which is involved in the
   induction of  dorsoventral polarity of the embryo. It has 11 LDLRA domains,
   3 of which miss the first disulfide bond (C1-C3).
 - Avian subgroup A rous sarcoma virus receptor (1 copy of LDLRA).
 - Bovine  Sco-spondin,  which  is  secreted  by  the  subcommissural organ in
   embryos and  is  involved  in  the  modulation  of neuronal aggregation. It
   contains at least 2 EGF-like domains and 3 LDLRA domains.

The LDL-receptor class A domain contains 6 disulfide-bound cysteines [4] and a
highly conserved  cluster of negatively charged amino acids, of which many are
clustered  on one  face  of the module [2]. A schematic representation of this
domain is shown here:

In LDL-receptors  the  class  A  domains form the binding site for LDL [1] and
calcium [5].  The  acidic  residues between the fourth and sixth cysteines are
important for  high-affinity binding of positively charged sequences in LDLR's
ligands [6].  The  repeat  has  been  shown  [2]  to consist of a beta-hairpin
structure  followed by a series of beta turns. The binding of calcium seems to
induce no significant conformational change.

A number of different families of  proteins share a conserved domain which was
first characterized in  some  animal lectins  and  which seem to function as a
calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain [1,2,3]. This  domain, which
is known as the C-type lectin domain (CTL)  or as the carbohydrate-recognition
domain (CRD),  consists of about 110 to 130 residues. There are four cysteines
which are perfectly conserved and involved in two disulfide bonds. A schematic

The categories of proteins, in which the CTL domain has been found, are listed
below.

Type-II membrane proteins where the CTL domain  is  located  at the C-terminal
extremity of the proteins:

 - Asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR)  (also  known as hepatic lectins) [4].
   The ASGPR's  mediate the endocytosis of plasma glycoproteins  to  which the
   terminal  sialic acid  residue  in  their carbohydrate  moieties  has  been
   removed.
 - Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon  Fc receptor (lymphocyte IgE receptor),
   which plays  an  essential  role in the regulation of IgE production and in
   the differentiation of B cells.
 - Kupffer cell receptor.  A  receptor  with  an  affinity  for  galactose and
   fucose, that could be involved in endocytosis.
 - A number of proteins  expressed on the  surface of  natural killer T-cells:
   NKG2, NKR-P1,  YE1/88  (Ly-49),  CD69 and on B-cells: CD72, LyB-2. The CTL-
   domain in these proteins is  distantly related  to other CTL-domains; it is
   unclear whether they are likely to bind carbohydrates.

Proteins that consist of an N-terminal collagenous domain  followed  by a CTL-
domain [5], these proteins are sometimes called 'collectins':

 - Pulmonary surfactant-associated  protein  A (SP-A).   SP-A  is  a  calcium-
   dependent protein that binds to surfactant phospholipids and contributes to
   lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli of the
   mammalian lung.
 - Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D).
 - Conglutinin, a calcium-dependent lectin-like protein which binds to a yeast
   cell wall extract and to immune complexes through  the complement component
   (iC3b).
 - Mannan-binding proteins (MBP)  (also  known as  mannose-binding  proteins).
   MBP's  bind  mannose  and  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  in  a  calcium-dependent
   manner.
 - Bovine collectin-43 (CL-43).

Selectins (or LEC-CAM) [6,7]. Selectins are cell adhesion molecules implicated
in  the  interaction of  leukocytes  with  platelets  or vascular endothelium.
Structurally, selectins consist of a long extracellular domain, followed by  a
transmembrane  region  and  a  short  cytoplasmic  domain. The   extracellular
domain is itself composed of a CTL-domain,  followed by an EGF-like domain and
a variable number of SCR/Sushi repeats. Known selectins are:

 - Lymph node homing  receptor (also  known as L-selectin, leukocyte  adhesion
   molecule-1, (LAM-1), leu-8, gp90-mel, or LECAM-1)
 - Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1  (ELAM-1, E-selectin or LECAM-2).
   The ligand recognized by ELAM-1 is sialyl-Lewis x.
 - Granule membrane  protein 140 (GMP-140, P-selectin, PADGEM, CD62, or LECAM-
   3). The ligand recognized by GMP-140 is Lewis x.

Large proteoglycans  that contain a  CTL-domain followed by one copy of a SCR/
Sushi repeat, in their C-terminal section:

 - Aggrecan (cartilage-specific proteoglycan core protein).  This proteoglycan
   is a major component of the  extracellular matrix of cartilagenous  tissues
   where it has a role in the resistance to compression.
 - Brevican.
 - Neurocan.
 - Versican  (large  fibroblast  proteoglycan), a  large  chondroitin  sulfate
   proteoglycan that may play a role in  intercellular signalling.

In addition  to  the  CTL  and  Sushi domains, these proteins also contain, in
their N-terminal  domain,  an  Ig-like V-type region, two or four link domains
(see <PDOC00955>) and up to two EGF-like repeats.

Two type-I membrane proteins:

 - Mannose receptor from macrophages. This protein mediates the endocytosis of
   glycoproteins by macrophages in several  recognition  and uptake processes.
   Its extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed
   by eight tandem repeats of the CTL domain.
 - 180    Kd    secretory  phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). A protein whose
   structure is highly similar to that of the mannose receptor.
 - DEC-205  receptor.  This  protein    is  used by dendritic cells and thymic
   epithelial cells  to  capture  and  endocytose diverse carbohydrate-binding
   antigens and direct them to antigen-processing cellular compartiments. DEC-
   205 extracellular section consists of a fibronectin type II domain followed
   by ten tandem repeats of the CTL domain.
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed  of  2  FA58C  domains (see <PDOC00988>), a CTL
   domain, 2 VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a CTCK (see <PDOC00912>).

Various other proteins that uniquely consist of a CTL domain:

 - Invertebrate soluble galactose-binding lectins.  A category to which belong
   a humoral lectin from a  flesh fly; echinoidin, a lectin from  the coelomic
   fluid of a sea urchin; BRA-2 and BRA-3, two lectins from the coelomic fluid
   of a barnacle, a  lectin from the tunicate Polyandrocarpa misakiensis and a
   newt oviduct lectin. The  physiological  importance of these lectins is not
   yet known but they may play an important role in defense mechanisms.
 - Pancreatic stone protein (PSP)  (also known  as  pancreatic  thread protein
   (PTP), or reg), a protein that might act  as  an  inhibitor  of spontaneous
   calcium carbonate precipitation.
 - Pancreatitis associated protein (PAP), a  protein that might be involved in
   the control of bacterial proliferation.
 - Tetranectin, a plasma protein that binds  to  plasminogen  and  to isolated
   kringle 4.
 - Eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP), a cytotoxic protein.
 - A galactose specific lectin from a rattlesnake.
 - Two subunits of a coagulation factor IX/factor X-binding protein (IX/X-bp),
   a snake venom anticoagulant protein  which  binds with  factors IX and X in
   the presence of calcium.
 - Two subunits of  a  phospholipase A2 inhibitor from  the  plasma of a snake
   (PLI-A and PLI-B).
 - A lipopolysaccharide-binding  protein  (LPS-BP)  from  the  hemolymph  of a
   cockroach [8].
 - Sea raven antifreeze protein (AFP) [9].

As a signature pattern for this domain, we selected the C-terminal region with
its three conserved cysteines.

-Consensus pattern: C-[LIVMFYATG]-x(5,12)-[WL]-x-[DNSR]-x(2)-C-x(5,6)-
                    [FYWLIVSTA]-[LIVMSTA]-C
                    [The three C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 the distantly related natural killer T-cell and B-cell proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 12.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 2.

-Note: all CTL domains have five Trp residues before the second Cys,  with the
 exception of tunicate lectin and cockroach LPS-BP which have Leu.

-Note: this  documentation  entry  is linked to both a signature pattern and a
 profile. As  the  profile is much more sensitive than the pattern, you should
 use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so.

***********************************
* SUEL-type lectin domain profile *
***********************************

Lectins bind   to   specific   carbohydrate   residues  of  glycoproteins  and
glycolipids present  at  the  cell  surface.  This allow them to agglutinate a
variety of  cellular  types.  On  the  basis of sequence similarity and common
characteristics such  as  sugar  binding  specificity,  conserved carbohydrate
recognition domains,  and ion requirement the different lectins can be grouped
in different categories, like C-type, I-type, galectins, pentraxins and P-type
lectin.

The sea  urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) egg lectin (SUEL) forms a new class
of lectins.  Altough SUEL was first isolated as a D-galactoside binding lectin
it was  latter  shown  that  it  bind  to  L-rhamnose preferentially [1,2]. L-
rhamnose and  D-galactose  share the same hydroxyl group orientation at C2 and
C4 of  the pyranose ring structure. SUEL is a lectin that exist as a disulfide
linked homodimer.  The dimeric form is essential for hemagglutination activity
but the  monomeric  form  retains  carbohydrate binding capacity [1]. Based on
primary structure  analysis,  a  cysteine-rich  domain  homologous to the SUEL
protein has been identified in the following proteins [3,4,5]:

 - Plant  beta-galactosidases  (EC 3.2.1.23)  (lactases).  They  constitute  a
   widespread family  of  enzymes  characterized by their ability to hydrolyse
   terminal, non-reducing beta D-galactosyl residues from beta-D-galactosides.
 - Mammalian     latrophilin,  the  calcium  independent  receptor  of  alpha-
   latrotoxin (CIRL).  It  belongs to the secretin family of G-protein coupled
   receptors. The  lectin  domain is not required for alpha-latratoxin binding
   [5].
 - Human lectomedin-1.
 - Rhamnose-binding  lectin (SAL) from catfish (Parasilurus asotus) eggs. This
   protein is  composed  of three tandem repeat domains homologous to the SUEL
   lectin domain.  All  cysteine  positions  of  each  domain  are  completely
   conserved [2].
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   hypothetical   proteins  B0457.1,  F32A7.3A  and
   F32A7.3B.
 - Human hypothetical protein KIAA0821.

* Link domain signature *
*************************

The link  domain [1] is a hyaluronan(HA)-binding  region  found in proteins of
vertebrates that  are  involved  in the assembly of extracellular matrix, cell
adhesion, and  migration. It is about 100 amino acids in length. The structure
has been  shown [2]  to consist of two alpha helices and two antiparallel beta
sheets  arranged  around  a large  hydrophobic  core similar to that of C-type
lectin <See  PDOC00537>.  As shown in the schematic representation this domain
contains four conserved cysteines involved in two disulfide bonds.

The link  domain has also been termed HABM [1] (HA binding module) and PTR [3]
(proteoglycan tandem repeat). Proteins with such a domain are listed below:

 - The cartilage link protein (LP), a proteoglycan that togethers with HA  and
   aggrecan forms  multimolecular aggregates. It consists of an Ig-like V-type
   domain and two copies of the link domain.
 - The  proteoglycans  aggrecan,  brevican,  neurocan  and versican, which are
   expressed in  the  CNS.  These  proteins  are composed of an Ig-like V-type
   region, two  or  four  (only  in aggrecan) link domains, up to two EGF-like
   repeats, a variable length domain containing the site of attachments of the
   sugars, followed, in the C-terminal by a C-type lectin and a Sushi domain.
 - CD44  antigen. The main cell surface receptor for HA. CD44 is known by many
   different names  and  also  exists in many different forms due to extensive
   alternative splicing  of its 19 exons. It contains a single N-terminal link
   domain, which has been shown to be involved in HA-binding [4].
 - Tumor  necrosis  factor-inducible protein TSG-6. It is possibly involved in
   cell-cell and    cell-matrix    interactions    during   inflammation   and
   tumorgenesis. It contains a link domain and a CUB domain.

We developed  a  signature  pattern  for  this domain, which is located in the

* Osteonectin domain signatures *
*********************************

The following extracellular proteins  contain, in their C-terminal section,  a
domain of  about 240 amino acids which is highly conserved [1]. These proteins
are:

 - SPARC  (also known as Osteonectin or BM-40), a glycoprotein that appears to
   regulate cell growth through interactions with the extracellular matrix and
   cytokines. It binds calcium and copper, several types of collagen, albumin,
   thrombospondin, PDGF  and  cell  membranes.  There  are two calcium binding
   sites; a acidic domain that binds 5 to 8 Ca++ with a low affinity and a EF-
   hand loop that binds a Ca++ ion with a high affinity. SPARC is expressed at
   high levels in tissues undergoing morphogenesis, remodeling and repair.
 - SC1, a mammalian brain extracellular matrix protein.
 - QR1, an avian protein, specifically expressed in the neuroretina.

This domain    has  a N-terminal section of about 90 residues that contains 11
conserved cysteines, a  central  section  that is probably in an alpha-helical
conformation, and a C-terminal section that contains two EF-hand type calcium-
binding regions   [2]  and  three  conserved  cysteines.    This  topology  is
schematically represented below.

                                                                     +----+

* OTU domain profile *
**********************

An homology  region  containing  four  conserved motifs has been identified in
proteins from  eukaryotes,  several  groups  of  viruses  and  the  pathogenic
bacteria Chlamydia  pneumoniae  [1].  None  of  these  proteins  has  a  known
biochemical function  but low sequence similarity with the polyprotein regions
of arteriviruses  has  lead to suggest that it could possess cysteine protease
activity [1].  In  this  case, the conserved cysteine and aspartate in motif I
and the  histidine  in motif IV could be the catalytic residues. Motifs II and
III have  a  more  limited  sequence  conservation  and  could  be involved in
substrate recognition [1]. 

It has  been  proposed  that  the eukaryotic proteins containing an OTU domain
could mediate  proteolytic  events  involved  in signaling associated with the
modification of chromatin structure and control of cell proliferation [1].

Some proteins containing a OTU domain are listed below [1]:

 - Ovarian Tumor (OTU), a Drosophila protein involved in oocyte morphogenesis.
   As the  putative catalytic cysteine is replaced by a serine it is not clear
   whether OTU is an active protease or in inactivated protease homologue.
 - Putative HIV-1 induced protein (HIN1), the human homologue of OTU. 
 - B0546.2 protein, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of OTU.
 - M2 protein from La France disease virus.
 - Tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-induced  protein  A20  (TNP3)  from mammals. It
   protects cells  from  apoptosis and blocks activation of lymphoid cells. In
   addition to  the  OTU domain, TNP3 contains several copies of a zinc finger
   like motif  that is also present in other proteins implicated in ubiquitin-
   dependent proteolysis.
 - Hypothetical  protein  YFL044C  from  yeast, a protein that also contains a
   C2H2-type DNA-binding zinc finger.
 - Hypothetical protein F12K2.7 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana.
 - Hypothetical protein C25D7.8 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans.
 - Hypothetical protein CPN0483 from Chlamydia pneumoniae.

The profile we developed covers the entire OTU domain.

* Somatomedin B domain signature *
**********************************

Somatomedin B, a serum  factor of  unknown  function, is  a  cysteine-rich  45
residues  peptide  which  is  proteolytically   derived  from  the  N-terminal
extremity  of the cell-substrate adhesion protein vitronectin [1]. Somatomedin
B-like domains are also found [2] in the following proteins:

 - Plasma-cell membrane glycoprotein PC-1.  PC-1, a  protein  with  nucleotide
   pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.9)  and alkaline phosphodiesterase I (EC 3.1.4.1)
   activities [3], is a  type-II  membrane protein of about 870 residues.  PC1
   consists of a short cytoplasmic  domain, followed by a transmembrane region
   and a large extracellular domain.  Two  tandem  copies  of a  somatomedin B
   domain are present in the N-terminal extremity of the extracellular domain.
 - Placental protein 11 (PP11).  PP11  is  a  placental protein  that seems to
   possess an amidolytic activity.  A  copy  of  the  somatomedin B  domain is
   present at the N-terminal extremity.

As shown in  the  following  schematic  representation  below  there are eight
conserved cysteines  in  the  somatomedin B  domain  and they are probably all
involved in disulfide bonds.

* Thyroglobulin type-1 repeat signature *
*****************************************

Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a large  glycoprotein  specific to the thyroid gland and
it is  the  precursor  of  the  iodinated  thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3).  The  N-terminal  section of Tg  contains 10 repeats of
a domain of  about 65 amino  acids which is known as the Tg type-1 repeat [1].
[1,2]. Such a domain has also been found (as a single or repeated sequence) in
the proteins listed below:

 - In the HLA class II associated invariant  chain [3].  In  that protein  the
   type-1 repeat is encoded by  an exon which is alternatively  spliced and is
   only present in a longer form of the protein.
 - In human pancreatic carcinoma marker proteins GA733-1 and GA733-2 (which is
   also known as epithelial  cell  surface antigen  (EPG)  or  adenocarcinoma-
   associated antigen (KSA) or antigen KS 1/4). These proteins may function as
   growth factor receptors [4].
 - In nidogen (entactin), a sulfated glycoprotein  which is widely distributed
   in basement membranes and that is tightly associated with laminin.  Nidogen
   probably has a role in cell-extracellular matrix interactions.
 - In  the  insulin-like  growth  factor  binding  proteins  (IGFBP)  [5] (see
   <PDOC00194>).

* P-type ('Trefoil') domain signature *
***************************************

A cysteine-rich  domain of  approximately forty five   amino-acid residues has
been found in some extracellular eukaryotic proteins [1,2,3,4]. This domain is
known as  either the 'P', 'trefoil' or 'TFF' domain. It contains six cysteines
that are  linked  by  three  disulfide  bonds.  Proteins known to contain this
domain are:

 - Protein pS2 (TFF1), a protein secreted by the stomach mucosa, whose gene is
   induced by  estrogen.  The  exact  function  of  pS2  is not known. It is a
   protein of about 65 residues and it contains a copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Spasmolytic  polypeptide  (SP) (TFF2), a protein of about 115 residues that
   inhibits gastrointestinal motility  and gastric acid secretion. SP could be
   a growth factor. It contains two tandem copies of the 'P' domain.
 - Intestinal  trefoil  factor (ITF) (TFF3), an intestinal protein of about 60
   residues which  may  have a role in promoting cell migration. It contains a
   copy of the 'P' domain.
 - Xenopus stomach proteins xP1 (one 'P' domain) and xP4 (four 'P' domains).
 - Xenopus  integumentary  mucins  A.1  (FIM-A.1 or preprospasmolysin) and C.1
   (FIM-C.1). These  proteins  could  be involved in defense against microbial
   infections by  protecting the epithelia from external environment. They are
   large proteins  (400 residues for A.1; more than 660 residues for C.1 whose
   sequence is  only partially known) that contain multiple copies  of the 'P'
   domain interspersed  with  tandem repeats of threonine-rich, O-glycosylated
   regions.
 - Xenopus  skin protein xp2 (or APEG) a protein that contains two 'P' domains
   and which  exists  in  two  alternative  spliced forms that differ from the
   inclusion of a N-terminal region of 320 residues that  consist of 33 tandem
   repeats of a G-[GE]-[AP](2,4)-A-E motif.
 - Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B) (also known as ZP-X in rabbit
   and ZP-3  alpha in pig). This protein is a receptor-like glycoprotein whose
   extracellular region  contains  a  'P'  domain followed by a ZP domain (see
   <PDOC00577>).
 - Intestinal  sucrase-isomaltase    (EC 3.2.1.48 / EC 3.2.1.10), a vertebrate
   membrane-bound, multifunctional  enzyme  complex  which hydrolyzes sucrose,
   maltose and isomaltose (see <PDOC00120>).
 - Lysosomal  alpha-glucosidase    (EC  3.2.1.20) (acid maltase), a vertebrate
   extracellular glycosidase (see <PDOC00120>).

Structurally the P-type domain can be represented as shown below.

* Cellulose-binding domain, bacterial type *
********************************************

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzyme such  as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1].

Structurally,  cellulases  and  xylanases  generally   consist  of a catalytic
domain joined  to  a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) by a short linker sequence
rich in proline and/or hydroxy-amino acids.

The CBD of a number of bacterial cellulases has been shown to consist of about
105 amino acid residues [2]. Enzymes known to contain such a domain are:

 - Endoglucanase (gene end1) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
 - Endoglucanases A (gene cenA) and B (cenB) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Exoglucanases A (gene cbhA) and B (cbhB) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Endoglucanase E-2 (gene celB) from Thermomonospora fusca.
 - Endoglucanase A (gene celA) from Microbispora bispora.
 - Endoglucanases A  (gene celA),  B (celB)  and  C  (celC)  from  Pseudomonas
   fluorescens.
 - Endoglucanase A (gene celA) from Streptomyces lividans.
 - Exocellobiohydrolase (gene cex) from Cellulomonas fimi.
 - Xylanases A (gene xynA) and B (xynB) from Pseudomonas fluorescens.
 - Arabinofuranosidase C   (EC 3.2.1.55)    (xylanase C)    (gene xynC)   from
   Pseudomonas fluorescens.
 - Chitinase 63 (EC 3.2.1.14) from Streptomyces plicatus.
 - Chitinase C from Streptomyces lividans.

The CBD domain  is  found  either  at  the  N-terminal  or  at  the C-terminal
extremity of    these enzymes.  As it  is shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation, there  are two conserved cysteines in this CBD domain - one at
each extremity  of the domain - which have been shown [3] to  be involved in a
disulfide bond. There are also four conserved  tryptophan residues which could
be involved in the interaction of the CBD with polysaccharides.

**************************************************
* Chitin recognition or binding domain signature *
**************************************************

A conserved domain of 43 amino  acids  is  found  in  several plant and fungal
proteins that  have  a common  binding  specificity  for  oligosaccharides  of
N-acetylglucosamine [1].  This domain  may  be involved in the  recognition or
binding of chitin subunits. It has been found in the proteins listed below.

 - A number of non-leguminous plant lectins.  The  best characterized of these
   lectins are the  three highly homologous wheat  germ  agglutinins (WGA-1, 2
   and 3).  WGA  is  an  N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylneuraminic  acid  binding
   lectin which structurally consists of a fourfold repetition of the 43 amino
   acid domain.  The same type of structure is found in a barley root-specific
   lectin as well as a rice lectin.
 - Plants  endochitinases  (EC  3.2.1.14)  from  class  IA  (see <PDOC00620>).
   Endochitinases are  enzymes  that  catalyze  the hydrolysis of the beta-1,4
   linkages of  N-acetyl  glucosamine  polymers  of  chitin.  Plant chitinases
   function as a defense against chitin containing fungal pathogens.  Class IA
   chitinases generally contain one copy of the chitin-binding domain at their
   N-terminal extremity.  An  exception  is  agglutinin/chitinase [2] from the
   stinging nettle Urtica dioica which contains two copies of the domain.
 - Hevein [5], a wound-induced protein found in the latex of rubber trees.
 - Win1 and win2, two wound-induced proteins from potato.
 - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit [3]. The  toxin  encoded by
   the linear plasmid pGKL1 is composed of three subunits:  alpha,  beta,  and
   gamma. The  gamma  subunit  harbors  toxin  activity and inhibits growth of
   sensitive yeast  strains  in  the  G1  phase  of  the cell cycle; the alpha
   subunit, which is proteolytically  processed from  a  larger precursor that
   also contains the beta subunit, is a chitinase (see <PDOC00839>).

In chitinases, as well as in the potato wound-induced proteins, the 43-residue
domain directly follows the signal sequence and is therefore at the N-terminal
of the mature protein; in  the killer toxin alpha subunit it is located in the
central section of the protein.

The domain  contains  eight  conserved  cysteine  residues which have all been
shown, in  WGA, to be involved in disulfide bonds. The topological arrangement
of the four disulfide bonds is shown in the following figure:

The 'baculovirus  inhibitior  of  apoptosis  protein  repeat' (BIR) [1,2] is a
domain of about 70 residues arranged in tandem repeats separated by a variable
length linker,  that  seems  to  confer  cell death-preventing activity. It is
found in  proteins  belonging  to  the  IAP  (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins)
family. Members  of  this  family  contain two or three BIR repeats and a RING
finger (see <PDOC00449>) in their C-terminus (with the exception of NAIP).

Proteins that are known to contain this domain are listed below.

 - Baculoviruses apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs).
 - Mammalian apoptosis inhibitors 1 and 2 (IAP1 and IAP2).
 - Mammalian X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (X-linked IAP).
 - Chicken IAP (ITA).
 - Human neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP).
 - Drosophila apoptosis inhibitors 1 and 2 (Iap1 and Iap2).
 - African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) protein p27.

BIR contains  a  number of perfectly conserved residues including an histidine
and three  cysteines.  The signature pattern for BIR spans the total length of
the repeat. We also developed a profile that spans the whole repeat.

* WAP-type 'four-disulfide core' domain signature *

Small proteins that contain  8  cysteine residues  involved in disulfide bonds
have been called 'four-disulfide core' proteins [1]. It is probable that these
proteins share the same  tertiary  structure folding pattern, but many of them
are  not  related at  the  sequence level.  There is, however, a group of such
structurally related proteins which are listed below.

 - Whey acidic protein (WAP).  WAP  is  a  major component of  milk whey whose
   exact function is not yet known.  It  consists of two 'four-disulfide core'
   domains.
 - Antileukoproteinase 1 (HUSI),  a mucous  fluid serine proteinase inhibitor.
   HUSI consists of two 'four-disulfide core' domains.
 - Elafin, an elastase-specific inhibitor from human skin [2].
 - Sodium/potassium ATPase inhibitors SPAI-1, -2, and -3 from pig [3].
 - Chelonianin, a protease inhibitor from  the eggs  of  red sea turtle.  This
   inhibitor  consists of  two  domains:  an N-terminal domain which  inhibits
   trypsin and  belongs  to  the  BPTI/Kunitz  family  of  inhibitors,  and  a
   C-terminal domain  which  inhibits subtilisin and is a 'four-disulfide core
   domain'.
 - WDNM1 protein [4], involved in  the metastatic potential of adenocarcinomas
   in rats.

************************************************************************
* Phorbol esters / diacylglycerol binding domain signature and profile *
************************************************************************

Diacylglycerol (DAG) is an important second messenger. Phorbol esters (PE) are
analogues of   DAG  and  potent  tumor  promoters  that  cause  a  variety  of
physiological  changes when  administered  to  both  cells  and  tissues.  DAG
activates a  family of serine/threonine protein kinases, collectively known as
protein  kinase C (PKC) [1]. Phorbol esters can directly stimulate PKC. The N-
terminal region of PKC, known as C1, has  been shown [2] to bind PE and DAG in
a phospholipid and zinc-dependent fashion.  The C1 region contains one  or two
copies (depending  on  the isozyme of PKC)  of a cysteine-rich domain about 50
amino-acid residues  long and essential for DAG/PE-binding.  Such a domain has
also been found in the following proteins:

 - Diacylglycerol kinase  (EC 2.7.1.107)  (DGK)  [3], the enzyme that converts
   DAG into  phosphatidate.  It  contains  two  copies  of  the DAG/PE-binding
   domain in its N-terminal section.  At least five different forms of DGK are
   known in mammals.
 - N-chimaerin.  A  brain  specific  protein which shows sequence similarities
   with the  BCR  protein at its C-terminal part and contains a single copy of
   the DAG/PE-binding  domain  at its N-terminal part. It has been shown [4,5]
   to be able to bind phorbol esters.
 - The  raf/mil  family  of  serine/threonine  protein  kinases. These protein
   kinases contain a single N-terminal copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain.
 - The  unc-13  protein from Caenorhabditis elegans. Its function is not known
   but it  contains a copy of the DAG/PE-binding domain in its central section
   and has  been shown to bind specifically to a phorbol ester in the presence
   of calcium [6].
 - The vav oncogene.  Vav was generated by a genetic rearrangement during gene
   transfer  assays.  Its  expression  seems  to be  restricted  to  cells  of
   hematopoeitic origin. Vav seems [5,7] to contain a DAG/PE-binding domain in
   the central part of the protein.
 - The Drosophila GTPase activating protein rotund.

The DAG/PE-binding domain binds two zinc ions; the ligands of these metal ions
are probably the six  cysteines  and two histidines that are conserved in this
domain. We  have  developed  both  a signature pattern and a profile that span
completely the DAG/PE domain.

***********************************
* C2 domain signature and profile *
***********************************

Some isozymes  of  protein kinase C (PKC) [1,2] contain a domain, known as C2,
of about  116  amino-acid  residues which is located between the two copies of
the C1 domain  (that bind phorbol esters and diacylglycerol) (see <PDOC00379>)
and the  protein  kinase  catalytic  domain  (see  <PDOC00100>).  Regions with
significant homology [3,E1] to  the C2-domain have been found in the following
proteins:

 - PKC isoforms alpha, beta and gamma and Drosophila isoforms PKC1 and PKC2.
 - PKC  isoforms  delta,  epsilon  and  eta, Caenorhabditis elegans kin-13 and
   yeast PKC1 have a C2-like domain at the N-terminal extremity [4].
 - Yeast cAMP dependent protein kinase SCH9 contains a C2-like domain.
 - Mammalian   phosphatidylinositol-specific  phospholipase  C  (PI-PLC)  (see
   <PDOC50007>) isoforms  beta,  gamma  and  delta  as  well  as  several non-
   mammalian PI-PLCs have a C2-like domain C-terminal of the catalytic domain.
 - Mammalian and plants phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase have a C2-like domain in
   the central region of the 110 Kd catalytic subunit.
 - Yeast phosphatidylserine-decarboxylase 2 (gene PSD2)  contains  a C2 domain
   in its central region.
 - Cytosolic phospholipase D from plants and cytosolic phospholipase A2 have a
   C2-like domain at their N-terminus.
 - Synaptotagmins (p65). This is a family of related synaptic vesicle proteins
   that bind  acidic  phospholipids and that may have a regulatory role in the
   membrane interactions during trafficking of synaptic vesicles at the active
   zone of the synapse. All isoforms of synaptotagmins  have two copies of the
   C2 domain in their C-terminal region.
 - Rabphilin-3A, a synaptic protein contains two C2 domains.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-13 whose  function is not known.  Unc-13
   has a C2 domain in its central part and a C2-like domain at the C-terminus.
 - rasGAP and the breakpoint cluster protein bcr have  a  C2-domain C-terminal
   of a PH-domain.
 - Yeast protein BUD2 (or CLA2) has a C2-domain in the central region.
 - Yeast protein RSP5 and human protein NEDD-4, both proteins also  contain WW
   domains (see <PDOC50020>).
 - Perforin  (see  <PDOC00251>)  has  a C2 domain at the C-terminus. It is the
   only extracellular protein known to contain a C2 domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YML072C has a C2 domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YNL087W has three C2 domains.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F37A4.7 has two C2 domains.

The C2  domain  is  thought  to  be involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid
binding [5]. Since domains related to the C2 domain are also found in proteins
that do not bind calcium, other putative functions for the C2 domain like e.g.
binding to  inositol-1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate have been suggested [6]. Recently,
the 3D  structure  of  the  first C2 domain of synaptotagmin has been reported
[7], the domain forms an eight-stranded beta sandwich.

The signature pattern we developed for the C2 domain is located in a conserved
part of  that  domain,  the  connecting loop between beta strands 2 and 3. The
profile we developed for the C2 domain covers the total domain.

****************************
* CAP-Gly domain signature *
****************************

It has been shown [1]  that  some cytoskeleton-associated proteins (CAP) share
the presence  of a conserved, glycine-rich domain of about 42 residues, called
here CAP-Gly. Proteins known to contain this domain are listed below.

 - Restin (also known as cytoplasmic linker protein-170 or CLIP-170), a 160 Kd
   protein associated  with  intermediate  filaments  and that links endocytic
   vesicles to microtubules. Restin contains two copies of the CAP-Gly domain.
 - Vertebrate   dynactin  (150  Kd  dynein-associated  polypeptide;  DAP)  and
   Drosophila glued,  a  major  component  of  activator  I, a 20S polypeptide
   complex that stimulates dynein-mediated vesicle transport.
 - Yeast protein  BIK1  which seems  to  be  required  for  the  formation  or
   stabilization of  microtubules  during  mitosis  and  for spindle pole body
   fusion during conjugation.
 - Yeast protein NIP100 (NIP80).
 - Human  protein  CKAP1/TFCB,  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  protein  alp11 and
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F53F4.3. These proteins contain
   a N-terminal ubiquitin domain (see <PDOC00271>) and a C-terminal CAP-Gly
   domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein M01A8.2.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YNL148c.

Structurally, these  proteins  are made of three distinct parts: an N-terminal
section that  is  most  probably  globular  and contains the CAP-Gly domain, a
large central   region   predicted  to  be  in  an  alpha-helical  coiled-coil
conformation and, finally, a short C-terminal globular domain.

The signature for the CAP-Gly domain  corresponds  to the first 32 residues of
the domain and includes five of the six conserved glycines.

* Ly-6 / u-PAR domain signature *
*********************************

A variety of GPI-linked cell-surface glycoproteins are composed of one or more
copies of a conserved domain  of  about  100 amino-acid residues [1,2].  These
proteins are:

 - Urokinase  plasminogen  activator  surface  receptor  u-PAR, which binds to
   u-PA and is responsible for its proteolysis-independent signal transduction
   activation effects.
 - The mouse family of Ly-6 T-cell antigens (Ly-6A, -6C, -6E, -6F and -6G).
 - CD59  (MACIF  or  MIRL),  an  inhibitor  of  the complement membrane attack
   complex action.
 - Herpesvirus saimiri CD59-related protein (gene 15).
 - Mouse thymocyte B cell antigen (ThB).
 - Squid glycoprotein Sgp-2.

U-PAR contains  three  tandem  copies  of the domain, while all the others are
made up of a single domain.

As shown  in  the  following  schematic,  this  conserved  domain  contains 10
cysteine residues  involved in five disulfide bonds - in u-PAR, the first copy
of the domain lacks the fourth disulfide bond.

* MAM domain signature and profile *
************************************

A domain of about 170 amino acids has been recognized [1] in the extracellular
region of  functionally diverse proteins.   All these proteins have a modular,
receptor-like architecture consisting of a signal peptide, followed by a large
N-terminal extracellular   domain,   a   single  transmembrane  region  and  a
intracellular domain. These proteins are listed below.

 - Meprin.  This cell  surface glycoprotein  contains  a  zinc-metalloprotease
   domain capable  of  degrading a variety of polypeptides. Meprin is composed
   of two  structurally  related  subunits (alpha and beta) that form homo- or
   heterotetramers by  the  non-covalent  association of  two disulfide-linked
   dimers. In  both  subunits,  the  MAM domain is located after the catalytic
   domain.
 - Neuropilin  (A5 antigen), a calcium-independent cell adhesion molecule that
   function during  the  formation  of certain neuronal circuits. The sequence
   contains 2  CUB domains (see <PDOC00908>, 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>)
   and a MAM domain.
 - Receptor-like   tyrosine   protein   phosphatases   Mu,   Kappa  and  PCP-2
   (EC 3.1.3.48). These PTPases have an extracellular region which consists of
   a MAM  domain  followed  by an IG-like domain and four fibronectin-type III
   domains.
 - Vertebrate  enterokinase  (EC  3.4.21.9), a type II membrane protein of the
   intestinal brush  border, which activates trypsinogen. It consists at least
   of a  catalytic  light  chain and a multidomain heavy chain which has 2 LDL
   receptor class A domains (see <PDOC00929>), a MAM domain, a SRCR domain and
   a CUB domain (see <PDOC00604>).
 - Apical  endosomal glycoprotein from rat, a protein probably involved in the
   sorting and  selective  transport of receptors and ligands across polarized
   epithelia. This protein contains 6 MAM domains.
 - Xenopus  laevis  thyroid hormone induced protein B. This protein contains 4
   MAM domains.
 - Pig  zonadhesin,  a  protein that binds in a species-specific manner to the
   zona pellucida of the egg.

The MAM  domain  is likely to have  an  adhesive  function.  It  contains four
conserved cysteines which probably form two disulfide bridges. The pattern for
MAM contains the third conserved cysteine which is located in the central part
of the domain.

**********************
* PDZ domain profile *
**********************

PDZ domains  (also  called  Discs-large  homologous regions (DHR) or GLGF) are
conserved structural  elements  of  80 to 100 amino acids that were originally
identified in  the  post-synaptic density protein PSD-95, the Drosophila tumor
suppressor discs-large,  and  the  tight-junction  protein  ZO-1.  PDZ domains
occur as  single  or, more frequently, as multiple tandemly repeated copies in
a large  and  diverse  set of proteins from all eukaryotes [1,2]. The presence
of one  or  two  copies  of  PDZ  domains in some bacteria may be explained by
horizontal gene transfer [3]. 

Eukaryotic PDZ domains are multifunctional protein-protein interaction modules
that are  involved in the clustering of signaling molecules and play important
role in  organizing  protein  networks on membranes. In may cases, PDZ domains
bind to a signature motif ([FYST]-X-[FVA]) occurring at the very C-terminus of
target proteins.  PDZ  domains  are  also  able  to  form heterodimers, and to
interact with  internal  peptide  fragments of target proteins [1,2,4]. It has
been proposed  that  bacterial PDZ domains also possess C-terminal polypeptide
binding functions [3].

PDZ domains  are  compact globular domains that were originally called GLGF as
Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe is  a  relatively  conserved  element  of their sequences [1].
Resolution of  crystal and solution structures of PDZ domains with and without
ligands has  revealed  that  the  PDZ domain contains six beta-strands and two
alpha-helices [5,6,7,8].  The  C-terminal  motif  of  target proteins has been
shown to  bind in an anti-parallel fashion to a groove formed by the principal
alpha-helix and  the  second beta-strand of the PDZ domains [5,8]. The binding
site involved  in  the  heterodimerization  of  some  PDZ  domains is situated
opposite this  canonical  peptide binding groove. It is an about 30 residue C-
terminal extension  of  the PDZ domain, which forms a beta-hairpin finger. The
first strand  of the beta-hairpin finger mimics a canonical C-terminal peptide
ligand, inserting  into  the peptide binding groove of the PDZ domain from the
partner protein  [7,8].  It  has  been proposed that PDZ domains may bind in a
general fashion  to  non-terminal  sequences, possibly those with beta-finger-
type structures,  regardless  of  whether  or not they are found downstream of
other PDZ domains [9].

Some proteins known to contain a PDZ domain are listed below:

 - Eukaryotic membrane associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs).
 - Mammalian  amyloid  beta  A4  precursor  protein-binding family A proteins,
   putative function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis by binding to Munc18-1, an
   essential component of the synaptic vesicle exocytotic machinery.
 - Mammalian neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS).
 - Interleukin-16, the only known secreted member of the PDZ protein family.
 - Vertebrate  LIM-kinases  (LIMK),  which  display  serine/threonine-specific
   phosphorylation of myelin basic protein and histone in vitro.
 - Drosophila  InaD,    a  photoreceptor  scaffolding  protein  that assembles
   multiple signal transducing proteins at the membrane via its 5 PDZ domains.
 - Bacillus subtilis stage IV sporulation B protein (spOIVB).
 - Bacterial  gspC  proteins, involved in protein export via type II secretion
   systems.
 - Bacterial  periplasmic  serine  proteases  high-temperature  requirement  A
   (htrA) and tail-specific protease (tsp).

*********************
* PH domain profile *
*********************

The 'pleckstrin  homology'  (PH) domain is a domain of about 100 residues that
occurs in  a  wide range of proteins involved in intracellular signaling or as
constituents of the cytoskeleton [1 to 7].

The function of this domain is not clear, several putative functions have been
suggested:

 - binding to the beta/gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins,
 - binding to lipids, e.g. phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate,
 - binding to phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues,
 - attachment to membranes by an unknown mechanism.

It is  possible  that  different  PH  domains  have  totally  different ligand
requirements.

The 3D  structure  of  several  PH  domains has been determined [8]. All known
cases have  a  common  structure consisting of two perpendicular anti-parallel
beta sheets,  followed by a C-terminal amphipathic helix. The loops connecting
the beta-strands  differ  greatly  in  length, making the PH domain relatively
difficult to  detect.  There  are  no totally invariant residues within the PH
domain.

Proteins reported  to  contain  one  more  PH  domains belong to the following
families:

 - Pleckstrin, the protein where this domain was first detected, is  the major
   substrate of protein kinase C in platelets. Pleckstrin  is  one of the rare
   proteins to contains two PH domains.
 - Ser/Thr protein  kinases such as the Act/Rac  family,  the  beta-adrenergic
   receptor kinases, the mu isoform of PKC and the trypanosomal NrkA family.
 - Tyrosine protein kinases belonging to the Btk/Itk/Tec subfamily.
 - Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1).
 - Regulators  of  small  G-proteins  like guanine nucleotide releasing factor
   GNRP (Ras-GRF) (which contains 2 PH domains), guanine  nucleotide  exchange
   proteins like  vav,  dbl,  SoS  and yeast CDC24, GTPase activating proteins
   like rasGAP and BEM2/IPL2, and the human break point cluster protein bcr.
 - Cytoskeletal  proteins  such  as  dynamin (see <PDOC00362>), Caenorhabditis
   elegans kinesin-like  protein  unc-104  (see  <PDOC00343>),  spectrin beta-
   chain, syntrophin (2 PH domains) and yeast nuclear migration protein NUM1.
 - Mammalian  phosphatidylinositol-specific  phospholipase  C  (PI-PLC)   (see
   <PDOC50007>) isoforms  gamma  and  delta.  Isoform  gamma  contains  two PH
   domains, the  second  one  is  split  into two parts separated by about 400
   residues.
 - Oxysterol binding proteins OSBP, yeast OSH1 and YHR073w.
 - Mouse  protein  citron,  a putative rho/rac effector that binds to the GTP-
   bound forms of rho and rac,
 - Several yeast proteins involved in cell cycle  regulation and bud formation
   like BEM2,  BEM3,  BUD4  and the BEM1-binding proteins BOI2 (BEB1) and BOI1
   (BOB1).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein MIG-10.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C04D8.1, K06H7.4 and ZK632.12.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YBR129c and YHR155w.

The profile for the PH domain, which has been developed by  Toby Gibson at the
EMBL, covers  the  total  length  of  domain.  Several  proteins contain large
insertions in  the  PH  domain  and  are  thus  difficult  to detect with this
profile. In  some of these cases,  the  profile will align only to one half of
the PH domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.  But it
 should be  noted that while all sequences containing PH domains are detected,
 not all  PH  domains  are.  Some  of  the  split domains lie below the cutoff
 threshold.

* Phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PID) profile *
****************************************************

Besides SH2 (see  <PDOC50001>), the phosphotyrosine interaction domain (PID or
PI domain)   is   the  second  phosphotyrosine-binding  domain  found  in  the
transforming protein   Shc   [1,2,3].  Shc  couples  activated  growth  factor
receptors to  a  signaling  pathway  that  regulates    the   proliferation of
mammalian cells  and  it  might  participate  in  the transforming activity of
oncogenic tyrosine  kinases. The PID of Shc specifically binds to the Asn-Pro-
Xaa-Tyr(P) motif  found  in  many  tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins  including
growth factor receptors. PID has also been found in the proteins listed below.

 - Mammalian  Shc transforming protein which contains one N-terminal PID and a
   C-terminal SH2 domain.
 - Human Shc-related protein Sck that shares the same modular architecture.
 - Mammalian protein X11 which is expressed prominently in the nervous system.
   It contains 2 disc homologous regions (DHR) downstream of the PID.
 - Rat    FE65,  a  transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in
   liver. The  presence  of  a  WW  domain (see <PDOC50020>) as well as 2 PIDs
   indicate a possible role in signal transduction.
 - Drosophila nuclear Numb protein, which is required in determination of cell
   fate during sensory organ formation in Drosophila embryos. It has one PID.
 - Drosophila  protein  disabled  (gene  dab),  which is involved in embryonic
   neural development.  This  cytoplasmic,  tyrosine phosphorylated protein is
   found in CNS axons and body wall muscles. It contains one N-terminal PID.
 - Mouse  mitogen-responsive  phosphoprotein P96 and the human homolog, DOC-2.
   They possess one N-terminal PID.
 - Mammalian regulator of G-protein signalling 12 (RGS12).
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  protein  F56D2.1  which  contains an
   N-terminal insulinase-type domain (see <PDOC00130>) followed by a PID.

PID has  an average length of about 160 amino acids. It is probably a globular
domain with  an  antiparallel beta sheet. The function of this domain might be
phosphotyrosine-binding. It  is at least expected to be involved in regulatory
protein/protein-binding [3].

* Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain profile *
**************************************************

The polycystic  kidney  disease  (PKD)  domain  is  an 80-90 amino acid module
originally found  in 16 copies in the extracellular segment of polycystin-1, a
large cell  surface  glycoprotein.  Polycystin-1  is encoded by the PKD1 gene,
which is  mutated  in  autosomal  dominant  polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
Although its  function  is  unknown, it may be involved in protein-protein and
protein-carbohydrate interactions based on its predicted domain structure. One 
or more copies of the PKD domain are also found in several other extracellular
proteins from higher organisms, eubacteria, and archaebacteria. Singles copies
of the  PKD  domain  are  found  in the melanocytes heavily glycosylated cell-
surface proteins   Pmel 17, MMP  and  Nmp.  Some  bacterial  collagenases  and
proteases also  contain  a  single  PKD  domain  adjacent  to  their catalytic
domains, whereas four copies  are  present in the heavily glycosylated surface
layer protein  of  archaebacteria  [1,2].  The PKD modules are often observed,
within a same protein sequence, in association with FnIII domains [3].

The most  conserved motif is the WDFGDGS sequence that is found in the central
part of   many   PKD  domains  and  could  play  a  structural  role  [1,2,4].
Determination of  the  solution  structure  of the first PKD domain from human
polycystin-1 has  shown  that  the module is built from two beta-sheet, one of
three strands and one of four strands, which are packed face-to-face [4].

Some proteins containing a PKD domain are listed below:

 - Polycystin-1 (PKD1). 
 - Vertebrate proteins of the Pmel-17/NMB family.
 - Archaeal surface-layer proteins.
 - Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio alginolyticus microbial collagenases.
 - Achromobacter lyticus protease I.

The profile we developed covers the entire PKD domain.

**********************
* RGS domain profile *
**********************

Regulators of  G-protein  signaling  (RGS)  proteins  are  a  family of highly
diverse, multifunctional  signaling  proteins  that  are  found  in eukaryotic
species ranging  from yeast to mammals. They act as GTPase activating proteins
(GAPs) that  reduce  the  signal  transmitted  by  the receptor-activated (GTP
bound) G-alpha  subunit  by  rapidly  returning  it to the inactive state (GDP
bound). Although  they are a diverse group of proteins, all RGS family members
share a  conserved 120 amino acid domain, the RGS domain. The RGS domain binds
to activated  G-alpha subunits and is responsible for GAP function. Apart from
the RGS  domain,  RGS  proteins  differ widely in their overall size and amino
acid identity  and  possess  a  remarkable  variety  of structural domains and
motifs. These   additional  domains,  like  DEP  (see  <PDOC50186>,  PDZ  (see
<PDOC50106> or  PH  (see <PDOC50003>, link the RGS proteins to other signaling
network, where they constitute effector type molecules [1,2,3].

RGS domains  are  broken  up  into  three  highly  conserved  GH  (GAIP or GOS
homology) subdomains (GH1, GH2 and GH3), which can be either nearly contiguous
or widely  dispersed  within  nonconserved  sequences  [3].  Resolution of the
crystal structure of the RGS4 protein complexed with a stable transition state
mimic of G-alpha-GTP has revealed that the RGS domain forms nine alpha-helices
that fold into two small subdomains. These subdomains each contact the G-alpha
surface at three distinct sites [4].

Some proteins known to contain a RGS domain are listed below:

 - Mammalian regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins.
 - Mammalian G-alpha interacting protein (GAIP).
 - Mammalian  G-protein-coupled-receptor kinases (GRK), proteins that directly
   phosphorylate GPCRs to regulate signaling.
 - Animal  axin/conductin,  an  inhibitor of the wg/wnt signaling pathway. The
   RGS domain   of   axin/conductin   interacts   with  the  tumour-suppressor
   adenomatous polyposis   coli  (APC),  a  non-G-alpha-like  molecule,  which
   indicates that some RGS domains can bind to proteins other than G-alpha.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  Egl-10,  which  regulates  G  protein signaling in
   nervous system.
 - Drosophila Loco, a protein required for glial differentiation.
 - Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  SST2,  a  negative  regulator  of the G protein-
   coupled mating pheromone signaling pathway.

We have developed a profile that covers the entire RGS domain.

**********************
* SET domain profile *
**********************

The SET  domain  is  an  130-  to  140-amino acid, evolutionary well conserved
sequence motif  that  was  initially  characterized in the Drosophila proteins
Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste  and Trithorax. In addition to these chromosomal
proteins modulating gene activities and/or chromatin structure, the SET domain 
is found  in  proteins of diverse functions ranging from yeast to mammals, but
also including some bacteria and viruses [1,2]. 

The SET  domains  of  mammalian SUV39H1 and 2 and fission yeast clr4 have been
shown to  be  necessary  for  the  methylation  of  lysine-9 in the histone H3
N-terminus [2].  However,  this histone methyltransferase (HTMase) activity is
probably restricted  to  a  subset  of  SET domain proteins as it requires the
combination of  the  SET  domain  with adjacent cysteine-rich regions that can
lack in  some  proteins. The SET domain containing plant MTases for example do
not comprise  the SET-domain-associated cysteine-rich region or the C-terminal
tail with  its  three conserved cysteines and are unable to methylate histones
[2]. The  Hrx  and  E(z)  proteins,  that  also  lack one of the cysteine-rich
regions, are  even  totally devoid of MTase activity [2] but interact with the
paired-helical motif  of  a  specific family of proteins displaying similarity
with dual-specificity phosphatase [3]. 

Sequence analysis suggest a bipartite structure of the SET domain. The regions
of highest  identities  are  found  in  two  short amino acid stretches in the
C-terminal half of the SET domain core: NHSC and GEX(5)Y [2]. 

The PR domain, first noted as the PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous region, is found in
a sub-class  of  zinc  finger  containing  proteins that appear to function as
negative regulators  of  tumorigenesis. His significant sequence identity with
the SET  domain  has  led to suggest that the PR domain is a derivative of SET
domain [4].  

Some proteins currently known to include a SET or PR domain are listed below:

 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  CURLY  LEAF  (CLF)  protein. It is homologous to the
   Drosophila E(z)  protein and is necessary for stable repression of a floral
   homeotic gene.
 - Drosophila    Enhancer-of-zeste (E(z)), which belongs to the polycomb group
   of genes  needed  to  maintain  the segment specific repression of homeotic
   genes.
 - Drosophila  Suppressor  of  variegation  3-9  (Su(var)3-9), heterochromatic
   protein implied in position effect variegation.
 - Drosophila Trithorax (trx). Founding member of the trithorax group of genes
   needed to maintain the segment specific activation of homeotic genes.
 - Fission   yeast cryptic loci regulator 4 (clr4), the homolog of  Drosophila
   Su(var)3-9. It  is  essential  for silencing of centromeres and the mating-
   type loci.
 - Mammalian  Hrx  protein.  In human, this homologue of Trx implicated in the
   onset of translocation-induced leukaemia.
 - Mammalian PRDI-BF1/Blimp-1, a PR domain containing protein, which acts as a
   transcriptional repressor of the c-myc oncogene.
 - Mammalian  Retinoblastoma-interacting  zinc-finger  protein  1 (RIZ1). RIZ1
   contains a N-terminal PR domain. 
 - Mammalian  SUV39H1  and  SUV39H2.  Homologs  of  Drosophila  Su(var)3-9 and
   fission yeast clr4.
 - Some  plant methyltransferase. They contain an insertion of about 100 amino
   acids in  the  middle  of  the SET domain and do not comprise a SET-domain-
   associated cysteine-rich  region  or  the  C-terminal  tail  with its three
   cysteines.
 - Yeast SET1. Important for mating-type switching and telomeric silencing.

We have  developed  a  profile that detect both the SET domain and the closely
related PR domain.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: the  profile  is  smaller  than  the  entire SET domain and misses some
 residues on both sides.

* Src homology 2 (SH2) domain profile *
***************************************

The Src  homology  2  (SH2) domain is a protein domain of about 100 amino-acid
residues first   identified   as  a  conserved  sequence  region  between  the
oncoproteins Src and Fps [1]. Similar sequences were later found in many other
intracellular signal-transducing   proteins   [2].  SH2  domains  function  as
regulatory modules  of  intracellular  signalling cascades by interacting with
high affinity  to  phosphotyrosine-containing  target  peptides in a sequence-
specific and strictly phosphorylation-dependent manner [3,4,5,6].

The SH2  domain  has  a conserved 3D structure consisting of two alpha helices
and six  to  seven  beta-strands.  The  core  of  the  domain  is  formed by a
continuous beta-meander composed of two connected beta-sheets [7].

So far, SH2 domains have been identified in the following proteins:

 - Many  vertebrate,  invertebrate  and  retroviral cytoplasmic (non-receptor)
   protein tyrosine kinases. In particular in the Src, Abl, Bkt, Csk and ZAP70
   families of kinases.
 - Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C gamma-1 and -2. Two
   copies of  the  SH2  domain  are  found  in  those  proteins in between the
   catalytic 'X-' and 'Y-boxes' (see <PDOC50007>).
 - Mammalian phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit.
 - Some vertebrate and invertebrate protein-tyrosine phosphatases.
 - Mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP).
 - Adaptor  proteins  mediating binding of guanine nucleotide exchange factors
   to growth  factor  receptors: vertebrate GRB2, Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5
   and Drosophila DRK.
 - Mammalian  Vav  oncoprotein,  a  guanine-nucleotide  exchange factor of the
   CDC24 family.
 - Miscellanous   proteins   interacting   with  vertebrate  receptor  protein
   tyrosine kinases: oncoprotein Crk, mammalian cytoplasmic proteins Nck, Shc.
 - STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription).
 - Chicken tensin.
 - Yeast transcriptional control protein SPT6.

The profile developed to detect SH2 domains is based on a structural alignment
consisting of  8  gap-free  blocks  and  7  linker  regions  totaling 92 match
positions.

* Src homology 3 (SH3) domain profile *
***************************************

The Src  homology  3 (SH3) domain is a small protein domain of about 60 amino-
acid residues first  identified as  a  conserved sequence in the non-catalytic
part of several cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src, Abl, Lck) [1].
Since then,  it  has  been  found in a great variety of other intracellular or
membrane-associated proteins [2,3,4,5].

The SH3  domain  has a characteristic fold which consists of five or six beta-
strands arranged  as  two tightly packed anti-parallel beta sheets. The linker
regions may contain short helices [6].

The function  of the SH3 domain is not well understood. The current opinion is
that they  mediate  assembly  of  specific  protein  complexes  via binding to
proline-rich peptides [7].

In general  SH3  domains  are  found  as single copies in a given protein, but
there is  a  significant number of protein with two SH3 domains and a few with
3 or 4 copies.

So far, SH3 domains have been identified in the following proteins:

 - Many  vertebrate,  invertebrate  and  retroviral cytoplasmic (non-receptor)
   protein tyrosine kinases. In particular in the Src, Abl, Bkt, Csk and ZAP70
   families of kinases.
 - Mammalian phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-gamma-1 and -2.
 - Mammalian phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase regulatory p85 subunit.
 - Mammalian Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP).
 - Adaptor  proteins  mediating binding of guanine nucleotide exchange factors

* Sterol-sensing domain (SSD) profile *
***************************************

The sterol-sensing domain (SSD) is an around 180 residues long cluster of five
membrane-spanning segments. Although the SSD confers sensitivity to regulation
by sterol  its  exact  function  is  not  clear.  It  is  not known whether it
interacts with  sterols,  such  as  cholesterol,  or whether it interacts with
another-sterol regulated  protein.  Alternatively,  the  SSD may interact with
lipids other than cholesterol [1,2].

Some proteins known to contain a SSD are listed below:

 - Patched  from  Drosophila.  It  is  receptor  for the cholesterol-activated
   protein sonic hedghog.
 - 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR).
 - Sterol   regulatory  element  binding-protein  cleavage-activating  protein
   (SCAP).
 - The  Niemann-Pick  type  C  (NPC1)  protein  [3].  It  is  involved  in the
   intracellular trafficking of cholesterol.

In addition  to  the  proteins  above,  the  SSD  is also found in a number of
bacterial drug resistance proteins.

***********************************************
* Thrombospondin type I repeat (TSP1) profile *
***********************************************

The thrombospondin  type  I  repeat (TSP1) was first identified as an about 57
amino acids  long  module  present  in  thrombospondin  1  and  2  and  in the
circumsporozoite (CS)  protein  of Plasmodium [1]. Since, a number of proteins
involved in  the  complement pathway (properdin, C6, C7, C8A, C8B, C9) as well
as extracellular  matrix  proteins  like  ADAMTS (see <PDOC50215>), mindin, F-
spondin or  SCO-spondin  and  TRAP  proteins  of Plasmodium have been found to
contain one  to  seven  TSP1s.  Within these TSP1 modules, the WSXW and CSVTCG
motifs are  highly  conserved  although  not  ubiquitous.  TSP1s may bind both
protein and glycoconjugate ligands [2].

Averaged secondary  structure  predictions  suggested  that  the  TSP1 has  an
elongated structure   and  contains  two  amphipathic  turn  regions  and  one
hydrophilic beta-strand region [3].

Some proteins known to contain TSP1s are listed below:

 - Mammalian ADAMTS, extracellular matrix proteases containing metalloprotease
   (see <PDOC50215>  and disintegrin (see <PDOC00351>) domains and one or more
   TSP1s. 
 - Vertebrate  C6 (3 TSP1s), C7 (2 TSP1s), C8A (2 TSP1s), C8B (2 TSP1s) and C9
   (1 or 2 TSP1s), components of the membrane attack complex of the complement
   system.
 - Vertebrate F-spondin, may contribute to the growth and guidance of axons in 
   both the spinal cord and the PNS. It contains six TSP1s.
 - Mammalian  properdin, a glycoprotein involved in the positive regulation of
   the alternative  pathway  of  the  complement  system  of immune defense by
   binding to   and  stabilizing  the  C3/C5-convertase  complexes.  Properdin
   contains six TSP1s. 
 - Mammalian semaphorins 5A and 5B which may act as positive axonal cues. They
   contain seven TSP1s. 
 - Vertebrate   thrombospondin  1  and  2.  Thrombospondins  are  a  class  of
   extracellular adhesive  proteins  that  mediate  cell-to-cell  and cell-to-
   matrix interactions.  They  contain six TSP1s. The anti-angiogenic activity
   of TSPs has been localized to the second and third TSP1s [4].
 - Plasmodium   circumsporozoite  (CS)  protein,  the  immunodominant  surface
   antigen on the sporozoite. The CS protein contains one TSP1.
 - Plasmodium  thrombospondin-related  anonymous protein (TRAP), implicated in
   the recognition and invasion of salivary glands by the sporozoite [5]. TRAP
   contains one TSP1.

The profile we developed covers the entire TSP1 domain.

*************************
* VWFC domain signature *
*************************

The VWFC  domain  is named after the von Willebrand factor (VWF) type C repeat
which is  found  twice  in  this multidomain protein [1,2]. It has a length of
about 70  amino acids covering 10 well conserved cysteines. Proteins with such
a domain [1-4] are listed below.

 - Human  von Willebrand factor  (VWF),  a multifunctional protein involved in
   maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 VWFD domains,  3 VWFA domains, 3
   VWFB domains,  2 VWFC  domains,  an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot.
   There might be a third VWFC domain within the type B domain region [2].
 - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
   mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
   lectin domain   (see   <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC  domains,  and  a  CTCK  (see
   <PDOC00912>).
 - Several  vertebrate heavily glycosylated  mucins. Human mucin 2 is secreted
   by the  epithelia  of  different  mucus membrane-containing organs. It is a
   highly polymorphic  multidomain molecule. Rat intestinal mucin-like peptide
   coats the  epithelia  of  the  intestines.  Both  proteins  share a modular
   architecture similar  to  VWF. Xenopus mucin B.1 contains a Sushi domain, a
   VWFC domain,  a  X  domain and a C-terminal cystine knot. Other mucins that
   contain the  VWFC  domain  are  human tracheobronchial mucin (MUC5), bovine
   submaxillary mucin-like protein, human and pig apomucin.
 - Cef-10/cyr61/CTGF/fisp-12/nov  protein  family.  The members of this family
   are structurally  related  to   insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
   (see <PDOC00194>) and could  function  as  growth  factor-binding proteins.
   They contain an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a VWFC repeat, a
   thrombospondin type 1 repeat (Tsp1) and a C-terminal cystine knot.
 - Vertebrate  thrombospondins  1  and 2. These adhesive glycoproteins mediate
   cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. They are composed of a common
   thrombospondin N-terminal  domain  (TspN),  a VWFC domain, three Tsp type 1
   repeats (Tsp1), 3 to 4 EGF-like domains and 7 calcium-binding Tsp3 repeats.
 - Vertebrate propeptides of fibrillar collagens alpha 1(I, II & III) and 2(V)
   chains that  contain  an  N-terminal  VWFC  domain, a collagenous region of
   about 1000  amino  acids  and  a  C-terminus  common to fibrillar collagens
   (COLFI domain).
 - Vertebrate  integral  membrane  protein  DGCR2/IDD,  a  potential  adhesion
   receptor with  1  LDL-receptor  class  A domain (see <PDOC00929>), a C-type
   lectin and a VWFC domain.
 - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.

Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].

********************************************
* WW/rsp5/WWP domain signature and profile *
********************************************

The WW  domain  [1-4,E1]  (also  known  as  rsp5  or  WWP) has been originally
discovered as a  short  conserved  region  in  a number of unrelated proteins,
among them  dystrophin,  the gene responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
The domain,  which  spans about 35 residues, is repeated up to 4 times in some
proteins.  It has  been    shown [5] to bind proteins with particular proline-
motifs, [AP]-P-P-[AP]-Y, and  thus  resembles somewhat SH3 domains. It appears
to contain  beta-strands  grouped  around  four  conserved aromatic positions;
generally Trp.  The  name  WW or WWP derives from the presence of these Trp as
well as  that  of a conserved Pro.  It  is  frequently  associated  with other
domains typical for proteins in signal transduction processes.

Proteins containing the WW domain are listed below.

 - Dystrophin,  a  multidomain cytoskeletal protein. Its longest alternatively
   spliced form consists of an N-terminal actin-binding domain, followed by 24
   spectrin-like repeats,  a  cysteine-rich  calcium-binding  domain  and a C-
   terminal globular domain. Dystrophin form tetramers and is thought to have
   multiple functions   including   involvement   in    membrane    stability,
   transduction of  contractile  forces  to the extracellular  environment and
   organization of  membrane specialization. Mutations in  the dystrophin gene
   lead to muscular dystrophy of Duchenne or Becker type.  Dystrophin contains
   one WW domain C-terminal of the spectrin-repeats.
 - Utrophin, a dystrophin-like protein of unknown function.
 - Vertebrate YAP protein is a substrate of an unknown serine kinase. It binds
   to the  SH3  domain  of the Yes oncoprotein via a proline-rich region. This
   protein appears in alternatively spliced isoforms, containing either one or
   two WW domains [6].
 - Mouse NEDD-4  plays a role in the embryonic development and differentiation
   of the central nervous system.  It contains 3 WW modules followed by a HECT
   domain.  The human  ortholog contains 4 WW domains, but the third WW domain
   is probably spliced resulting in an alternate NEDD-4 protein with only 3 WW
   modules [3].
 - Yeast  RSP5 is similar to NEDD-4 in its molecular organization. It contains
   an N-terminal  C2  domain  (see  <PDOC00380>,  followed by a histidine-rich
   region, 3 WW domains and a HECT domain.
 - Rat    FE65,  a  transcription-factor activator expressed preferentially in
   liver. The  activator  domain is located within the N-terminal 232 residues
   of FE65, which also contain the WW domain.
 - Yeast ESS1/PTF1, a putative peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase from family
   ppiC (see  <PDOC00840>).  A  related  protein,  dodo  (gene  dod) exists in
   Drosophila and in mammals (gene PIN1).
 - Tobacco  DB10  protein.  The  WW domain is located N-terminal to the region
   with similarity to ATP-dependent RNA helicases.
 - IQGAP,  a  human GTPase activating protein acting on ras. It contains an N-
   terminal domain  similar  to  fly  muscle mp20 protein and a C-terminal ras
   GTPase activator domain.
 - Yeast  pre-mRNA  processing  protein PRP40, Caenorhabditis elegans ZK1098.1
   and fission yeast SpAC13C5.02 are related proteins with similarity to MYO2-
   type myosin, each containing two WW-domains at the N-terminus.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans hypothetical protein C38D4.5, which contains one WW
   module, a PH domain (see <PDOC50003>) and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol
   3-kinase domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YFL010c.

For the  sensitive  detection of WW domains, we have developed a profile which
spans the whole homology region as well as a pattern.

***********************
* ZP domain signature *
***********************

A domain of about 260 amino acid-residues  has been recognized [1] in a number
of receptor-like eukaryotic glycoproteins listed below.

 - Sperm receptor proteins ZP2 and ZP3.  Along  with protein ZP1, proteins ZP2
   and ZP3 are responsible for sperm-adhesion to the zona pellucida. ZP3 first
   binds to specific sperm proteins, thus  mediating  sperm  contacts with the
   oocyte. ZP2  acts  as a second sperm receptor reinforcing the interactions.
   ZP1 cross-links the polymers formed by ZP2 and ZP3.
 - Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein B (ZP-B) (also known as ZP-X in rabbit
   and ZP-3 alpha in pig).
 - Glycoprotein GP2,  the  major  component  of  pancreatic  secretory granule
   membranes.
 - TGF-beta receptor type III (also  known  as betaglycan).  This protein is a
   proteoglycan that binds  to TGF-beta and could be involved in capturing and
   retaining TGF-beta for presentation to the signalling receptors.
 - Uromodulin (also known as Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein). The function
   of this  protein,  which  is  the  most abundant in human urine, is not yet
   clear.
 - Chicken beta-tectorin, a major glycoprotein of avian tectorial membrane.

All of  the above proteins are mosaic proteins composed of various domains and
that all  have a large extracellular region followed by either a transmembrane
region and  a  very  short  cytoplasmic  region or by a GPI-anchor. The domain
common to  these  proteins,  and that we call `ZP', is found in the C-terminal
section of  the  extracellular  region. The ZP domain contains eight conserved
cysteines probably involved in disulfide bonds.

As a signature pattern for this  domain  we  selected a region, in the central
part of the ZP domain, that contains two of the conserved cysteines.

*************************************
* S-layer homology domain signature *
*************************************

S-layers  are paracrystalline mono-layered assemblies of (glyco)proteins which
coat the surface of bacteria [1]. Several S-layer proteins and some other cell
wall proteins contain one or more copies  of a domain of about 50-60 residues,
which has been called SLH (for S-layer homology) [2]. There is strong evidence
that this domain serves as an anchor to the peptidoglycan [3].  The SLH domain
has been found in:

 - S-layer glycoprotein of Acetogenium kivui (3 copies).
 - S-layer 125 Kd protein of Bacillus sphaericus (3 copies).
 - S-layer protein of Bacillus anthracis (3 copies).
 - S-layer protein of Bacillus licheniformis (3 copies).
 - S-layer protein (HWP) from Bacillus brevis strain HPD31 (3 copies).
 - Middle cell wall protein (MWP) from Bacillus brevis strain 47 (3 copies).
 - S-layer protein (p100) of Thermus thermophilus (1 copy).
 - Outer membrane protein Omp-alpha from Thermotoga maritima (1 copy).
 - Cellulosome anchoring protein (gene ancA), outer layer protein B (OlpB) and
   a further potential cell surface glycoprotein from Clostridium thermocellum
   (3 copies; the first copy is missing its N-terminal third which is appended
   to the end of the third copy; may have arisen by circular permutation).
 - Amylopullulanase (gene amyB)  from Thermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenes (3
   copies)
 - Amylopullulanase (gene aapT) from Bacillus strain XAL-601 (3 copies).
 - Endoglucanase from Bacillus strain KSM-635 (3 copies).
 - Exoglucanase (gene xynX) from Clostridium thermocellum (3 copies).
 - Xylanase A (gene xynA) from Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum (2 copies; 3
   copies if a frameshift is taken into account).
 - Protein involved in  butirosin production (ButB) from Bacillus circulans (2
   incomplete copies; 3 copies if three frameshifts are taken into account).
 - Two hypothetical proteins from Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 (1 copy each).
 - A hypothetical protein with sequence similarity to amylopullulanases  found
   3' of amylase gene from Bacillus circulans (fragment of 1 copy; 3 copies if
   two frameshifts are taken into account).

SLH domains are found at the N- or C-termini of mature proteins. They occur in
single copy followed by a predicted coiled coil domain, or in three contiguous
copies. Structurally, the SLH domain is predicted to contain two alpha-helices
flanking a beta strand. The SLH sequences are fairly divergent with an average
identity of about 25%. It is however possible to build a sequence pattern that
starts at the second position of the domain and that spans 3/4 of its length.

* 'Homeobox' domain signature and profile *
*******************************************

The 'homeobox'  is  a  protein  domain  of  60  amino  acids [1 to 5,E1] first
identified in  a   number of Drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins. It
has since been  found to  be  extremely well conserved in many  other animals,
including vertebrates.  This  domain binds DNA through a helix-turn-helix type
of structure.  Some  of  the proteins which contain  a homeobox domain play an
important  role  in  development.  Most of  these  proteins  are  known  to be
sequence specific DNA-binding transcription factors.  The  homeobox domain has
also been found  to  be  very  similar  to  a  region of the yeast mating type
proteins. These are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that act as  master
switches in yeast differentiation  by  controlling  gene  expression in a cell
type-specific fashion.

A  schematic  representation  of  the  homeobox domain  is  shown below.   The
helix-turn-helix region is shown by the symbols  'H' (for helix), and 't' (for
turn).

* 'Homeobox' antennapedia-type protein signature *
**************************************************

The homeotic  Hox  proteins  are sequence-specific transcription factors. They
are part  of  a  developmental  regulatory  system  that  provides  cells with
specific  positional identities on the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis [1].  The
hox proteins  contain  a  'homeobox'  domain. In Drosophila and other insects,
there are eight different Hox genes  that  are  encoded in two gene complexes,
ANT-C and BX-C. In vertebrates there are 38 genes organized in four complexes.

In six of the eight Drosophila Hox genes the homeobox domain is highly similar
and a  conserved hexapeptide  is found five to sixteen amino acids upstream of
the homeobox domain. The six Drosophila proteins that belong to this group are
antennapedia (Antp),  abdominal-A (abd-A), deformed (Dfd), proboscipedia (pb),
sex combs reduced (scr)  and ultrabithorax (ubx) and are collectively known as
the 'antennapedia' subfamily.

In vertebrates  the  corresponding  Hox genes are known [2] as Hox-A2, A3, A4,
A5, A6,  A7,  Hox-B1,  B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, Hox-C4, C5, C6, C8, Hox-D1,
D3, D4 and D8.

Caenorhabditis elegans lin-39 and mab-5 are also members of the 'antennapedia'
subfamily.

As a signature pattern  for this subfamily of  homeobox proteins, we have used
the conserved hexapeptide.

-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 3.

-Note: Arg  and  Lys  are  most  frequently  found in the last position of the
 hexapeptide; other amino acids are found in only a few cases.

* 'Homeobox' engrailed-type protein signature *
***********************************************

Most proteins  which contain a 'homeobox' domain  can  be classified [1,2], on
the basis of their sequence characteristics, in three  subfamilies: engrailed,
antennapedia and paired.   Proteins currently known to belong to the engrailed
subfamily are:

 - Drosophila segmentation polarity protein engrailed (en) which specifies the
   body segmentation  pattern  and  is  required  for  the  development of the
   central nervous system.
 - Drosophila invected protein (inv).
 - Silk moth proteins engrailed and invected,  which  may  be  involved in the
   compartmentalization of the silk gland.
 - Honeybee E30 and E60.
 - Grasshopper (Schistocerca americana) G-En.
 - Mammalian and birds En-1 and En-2.
 - Zebrafish  Eng-1, -2 and -3.
 - Sea urchin (Tripneusteas gratilla) SU-HB-en.
 - Leech (Helobdella triserialis) Ht-En.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans ceh-16.

Engrailed homeobox proteins are characterized  by  the presence of a conserved
region of  some  20  amino-acid  residues  located  at  the  C-terminal of the
'homeobox' domain.  As  a signature pattern for this subfamily of proteins, we
have used a stretch of eight perfectly conserved residues in this region.

*********************************
* 'Paired box' domain signature *
*********************************

The 'paired box' [1,2] is a 124 amino-acid  conserved  domain  which  has been
found in the proteins listed  below (references are only provided for recently
determined sequences).

 - Drosophila segmentation pair-rule class protein paired (prd).
 - Drosophila segmentation polarity class proteins gooseberry proximal (gsb-p),
   and gooseberry distal (gsb-d).
 - Drosophila proteins Pox-meso and Pox-neuro.

 The PAX proteins:
 - Mammalian protein Pax1, which may play a role in the formation of segmented
   structures in the embryo. In mouse, mutations in Pax1 produce the undulated
   phenotype, characterized   by  vertebral  malformations  along  the  entire
   rostro-caudal axis.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax2,  a  probable transcription factor that may have a
   role in kidney cell differentiation.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax3.  Pax3  is expressed during early neurogenesis. In
   Man, defects  in  Pax3  are  the  cause  of Waardenburg's syndrome (WS), an
   autosomal dominant combination of deafness and pigmentary disturbance.
 - Mammalian protein Pax4.
 - Mammalian protein Pax5, also known as B-cell specific transcription factor
   (BSAP). Pax5  is  involved  in the regulation of the CD19 gene. It probably
   plays an  important  role  in  B-cell  differentiation  as  well  as neural
   development and spermatogenesis.
 - Mammalian  protein  Pax6  (oculorhombin).  Pax6 is probably a transcription
   factor with important functions in  eye  and  nasal  development.   In Man,
   defects in Pax6 are  the  cause  of  aniridia type II (AN2),  an  autosomal
   dominant disorder characterized by complete or partial absence of the iris.
 - Mammalian protein Pax7 [3].
 - Mammalian protein Pax8.
 - Mammalian protein Pax9.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pax[Zf-a] and Pax[Zf-b].

The function  of  this  conserved  domain  is  not  yet  known. This domain is
generally located  in the N-terminal section of the proteins. In some of these
proteins, there  is a homeobox domain (see <PDOC00027>) upstream of the paired
box.

We use  the  region  spanning  positions  35  to  51  of  the paired box, as a
signature pattern.

* 'POU' domain signatures *
***************************

The 'POU' (pronounced 'pow') domain [1 to 6] is a  70 to 75  amino-acid region
found upstream  of a homeobox domain in some eukaryotic transcription factors.
It is thought to confer high-affinity site-specific DNA-binding and to mediate
cooperative protein-protein  interaction  on  DNA. Proteins currently known to
contain a POU domain are listed below.

 - Oct-1  (or  OTF-1,  NF-A1)  (gene POU2F1), a transcription factor for small
   nuclear RNA and histone H2B genes.
 - Oct-2  (or  OTF-2,  NF-A2)  (gene  POU2F2),  a  transcription  factor  that
   specifically binds  to  the  immunoglobulin  promoters  octamer  motif  and
   activates these genes.
 - Oct-3  (or  Oct-4,  NF-A3)  (gene POU5F1), a transcription factor that also
   binds to the octamer motif.
 - Oct-6    (or   OTF-6, SCIP) (gene POU3F1), an octamer-binding transcription
   factor thought to be involved in early embryogenesis and neurogenesis.
 - Oct-7  (or  N-Oct 3, OTF-7, Brn-2) (gene POU3F2), a nervous-system specific
   octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Oct-11 (or OTF-11) (gene POU2F3), an octamer-binding transcription factor.
 - Pit-1  (or  GHF-1)  (gene  POU1F1),  a transcription factor that  activates
   growth hormone and prolactin genes.
 - Brn-1 (or OTF-8) (gene POU3F3).
 - Brn-3A (or RDC-1) (gene POU4F1), a probable transcription factor  that  may
   play a role in neuronal tissue differentiation.
 - Brn-3B (gene POU4F2), a probable transcription factor  that may play a role
   in determining  or  maintaining  the identities of a small subset of visual
   system neurons.
 - Brn-3C (gene POU4F3).
 - Brn-4 (or OTF-9) (gene POU3F4), a probable transcription factor which exert
   its primary  action  widely  during  early neural development and in a very
   limited set of neurons in the mature brain.
 - Mpou  (or  Brn-5,  Emb)  (gene  POU6F1),  a transcription factor that binds
   preferentially to a variant of the octamer motif.
 - Skn, that activates cytokeratin 10 (k10) gene expression.
 - Sprm-1,  a  transcription  factor  that binds preferentially to the octamer
   motif and  that  may exert a regulatory function in meiotic events that are
   required for terminal differentiation of male germ cell.
 - Unc-86,  a  Caenorhabditis  elegans  transcription  factor involved in cell
   lineage and differentiation.
 - Cf1-a, a Drosophila neuron-specific  transcription factor necessary for the
   expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (dcc).
 - I-POU, a Drosophila protein that forms a stable heterodimeric  complex with
   Cf1-a and inhibits its action.
 - Drosophila protein nubbin/twain (PDM-1 or DPou-19).
 - Drosophila protein didymous (PDM-2 or DPou-28) that may play multiple roles
   during development.
 - Bombyx mori silk gland factor 3 (SGF-3).

 - Xenopus proteins Pou1, Pou2, and Pou3.
 - Zebrafish proteins Pou1, Pou2, Pou[C], ZP-12, ZP-23, ZP-47 and ZP-50.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-6.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ceh-18.

We  have derived  two  signature patterns for the 'POU' domain.  The first one
spans positions 15 to 27 of the domain, the second positions 42 to 55.

********************************************************
* Zinc finger, C2H2 type, domain signature and profile *
********************************************************

'Zinc finger' domains [1-5]  are nucleic acid-binding protein structures first
identified in  the Xenopus  transcription  factor TFIIIA.   These domains have
since been found  in  numerous nucleic acid-binding proteins.   A zinc  finger
domain is composed of 25 to 30 amino-acid residues.  There are two cysteine or
histidine residues  at  both extremities of the domain,  which are involved in
the tetrahedral coordination of a zinc atom. It has been proposed that such  a
domain interacts  with about five nucleotides. A schematic representation of a
zinc finger domain is shown below:

                                 x  x
                               x      x
                              x        x
                              x        x
                              x        x
                              x        x
                               C      H
                             x   \  /   x
                            x     Zn     x
                             x  /    \  x

                      x x x x x        x x x x x

Many classes  of  zinc  fingers  are characterized according to the number and
positions of  the  histidine  and  cysteine residues involved in the zinc atom
coordination.  In the  first class to be characterized, called C2H2, the first
pair of zinc coordinating  residues  are cysteines, while the  second pair are
histidines. A  number  of  experimental  reports  have  demonstrated the zinc-
dependent DNA or RNA binding property of some members of this class.

Some of the proteins known to include C2H2-type zinc fingers are listed below.
We have indicated, between brackets, the number of zinc  finger regions  found
in each  of these proteins; a '+' symbol indicates that only partial  sequence
data is available and that additional finger domains may be present.

In addition to the conserved zinc ligand residues it has been shown [6] that a
number of other positions are  also  important for the structural integrity of
the C2H2 zinc fingers. The  best  conserved  position is  found  four residues
after the second cysteine; it is generally an aromatic or aliphatic residue. A
profile was also developed that spans the whole domain.

 are interrupted  by  insertions or deletions. Our pattern does not detect any
 of these finger domains.

******************************************
* Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) profile *
******************************************

The Krueppel-associated  box  (KRAB) is a domain of around 75 amino acids that
is found in the N-terminal part of about one third of eukaryotic Krueppel-type
C2H2 zinc  finger proteins (ZFPs) (see <PDOC00028>). It is enriched in charged
amino acids and can be divided into subregions A and B, which are predicted to
fold into  two  amphipathic  alpha-helices.  The  KRAB  A  and  B boxes can be
separated by  variable spacer segments and many KRAB proteins contain only the
A box [1].

The KRAB  domain functions as a transcriptional repressor when tethered to the
template DNA by a DNA-binding domain. A sequence of 45 amino acids in the KRAB
A subdomain  has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for transcriptional
repression. The  B  box  does  not  repress  by itself but does potentiate the
repression exerted  by the KRAB A subdomain [2,3]. Gene silencing requires the
binding of  the KRAB domain to the RING-B box-coiled coil (RBCC) domain of the
KAP-1/TIF1-beta corepressor.  As  KAP-1  binds to the heterochromatin proteins
HP1, it  has  been  proposed  that  the  KRAB-ZFP-bound  target  gene could be
silenced following recruitment to heterochromatin [4,5].

KRAB-ZFPs probably  constitute  the  single  largest  class  of  transcription
factors within  the  human  genome  [6]. Although the function of KRAB-ZFPs is
largely unknown,   they   appear   to   play   important   roles  during  cell
differentiation and development.

The profile we developed spans the complete KRAB domain.

*******************************
* KRAB-related domain profile *
*******************************

This domain  of  about  63  amino  acid residues is related to the KRAB domain
(see <PDOC50805>  and  has  been identified in the N-terminal ends of proteins
belonging to the SSX family [1,2,3]. Proteins of the SSX family lack the C2H2-
type zinc  finger  (see  <PDOC00028>)  which  is  invariably found in proteins
containing the KRAB domain. The KRAB-related domains show greatest homology to
the KRAB  A  subdomain  and contain a high proportion of the amino acids which
are usually  conserved  between  the KRAB A subdomains of zinc finger proteins
[1].

Although the   KRAB-related  domains  of  SSX1  and  SSX2  contribute  to  the
repressive activity  of  these  proteins, transcriptional repression is mainly
mediated by  a  region  located  in  their  C-terminus. Hence, unlike the KRAB
domain, the  KRAB-related  domain  is  only  a weak transcriptional repression
domain. In  addition  the  KRAB-related  domain is unable to interact with the
KAP-1/TIF1-beta protein which  appears  to function as a universal corepressor
for KRAB domain proteins [4].

Translocations which  result  in  the  fusion of the SYT gene to either of the
closely related  SSX1 or SSX2 genes are associated with synovial sarcomas [1].
The resulting  SYT-SSX1/SSX2  proteins  analyzed  so far lack the KRAB-related
domain and  act as activators of transcription [4]. 

The profile we developed spans the complete KRAB-related domain.

********************
* SCAN box profile *
********************

This domain of around 80 amino acid residues has been called LeR because it is
a leucine  rich  region [1], or SCAN box from the first letter of the names of
the four  proteins  initially  found  to  contain it (SRE-ZBP, CTfin-51, AW-1,
Number 18 cDNA) [2]. The  SCAN box is essentially found in the N-terminal part
of transcription  factors  containing  a  zinc  finger  of  the C2H2 type (see
<PDOC00028>). These  proteins  can  either  activate or repress transcription,
although  isolated  recombinant  SCAN boxes do not modulate significantly  the
transcription [1,2].  In  addition to these zinc finger transcription factors,
an  isolated  SCAN box without adjacent zinc finger motifs has been identified
in some proteins [3,4].

The SCAN box is enriched in hydrophobic and negatively charged residues with a
L-X(6)-L motif  at  its  core.  This  core  is  flanked by A, E, L, M, H and C
residues that  are  frequently  found in alpha-helices [2]. Predictions of the
secondary structure  of  the  domain  suggest  the  presence of at least three
alpha-helices that  are  separated  from  one  another by short looped regions
bounded by  proline  residues  [5].  It  has  been  shown  to  be a  selective
oligomerization domain  that  mediates  homotypic and heterotypic interactions
between SCAN box containing proteins [4,5].

The following zinc-finger proteins have been shown to contain a SCAN box:

 - CTfin-51,   a   mouse   protein   that  has  been  shown  to  be  a  strong
   transcriptional activator.
 - SRE-ZBP, a human transcription factor that could function as a repressor of
   c-fos transcription.
 - Zinc finger proteins ZNF24, ZNF165, ZNF174, ZNF191, ZNF192, ZNF193, ZNF202,
   ZNF215, ZNF232, ZNF263, ZFP-29, ZFP-38, and ZFP-95.

And a number of proteins devoid of C2H2-type zinc-finger domain:

 - PGC-2  (PPAR-gamma  coactivator  2)  [3], a human protein that binds to and
   increases the transcriptional activity of the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma.
 - SDP1  (SCAN-domain  protein  1) [4], a protein that interacts with the SCAN
   box of the zinc finger protein ZNF202.

The profile we developed spans the complete SCAN box.

* Zinc finger, C3HC4 type (RING finger), signature *
****************************************************

A number of eukaryotic and viral proteins  contain a  conserved  cysteine-rich
domain of  40  to  60 residues (called C3HC4 zinc-finger or 'RING' finger) [1]
that binds  two  atoms of zinc, and is probably involved in mediating protein-
protein interactions.  The  3D structure of the zinc ligation system is unique
to the RING domain  and is refered to  as the "cross-brace" motif. The spacing
of the cysteines in such a domain is C-x(2)-C-x(9 to 39)-C-x(1 to 3)-H-x(2  to
3)-C-x(2)-C-x(4 to 48)-C-x(2)-C.

Proteins currently  known  to  include  the  C3HC4  domain  are  listed  below
(references are only provided for recently determined sequences).

 - Mammalian   V(D)J   recombination  activating  protein  (gene  RAG1).  RAG1
   activates the rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes.
 - Mouse rpt-1. Rpt-1 is a trans-acting factor that regulates  gene expression
   directed by the promoter region  of the interleukin-2 receptor  alpha chain
   or the LTR promoter region of HIV-1.
 - Human rfp. Rfp is  a developmentally regulated protein that may function in
   male germ cell development. Recombination of the N-terminal section  of rfp
   with a protein tyrosine kinase produces the ret transforming protein.
 - Human 52 Kd Ro/SS-A protein. A protein of unknown function from the Ro/SS-A
   ribonucleoprotein  complex.     Sera  from  patients  with  systemic  lupus
   erythematosus or primary Sjogren's  syndrome  often contain antibodies that
   react with the Ro proteins.
 - Human histocompatibility locus protein RING1.
 - Human PML, a probable transcription factor.  Chromosomal  translocation  of
   PML with  retinoic receptor alpha  creates  a  fusion  protein which is the
   cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
 - Mammalian breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) [E1].
 - Mammalian cbl proto-oncogene.
 - Mammalian bmi-1 proto-oncogene.
 - Vertebrate CDK-activating kinase (CAK) assembly factor MAT1, a protein that
   stabilizes the  complex  between  the CDK7 kinase and cyclin H (MAT1 stands
   for 'Menage A Trois').
 - Mammalian  mel-18  protein. Mel-18 which is expressed in a variety of tumor
   cells is  a  transcriptional  repressor that recognizes and bind a specific
   DNA sequence.
 - Mammalian peroxisome  assembly factor-1 (PAF-1) (PMP35), which  is somewhat
   involved in the biogenesis of peroxisomes. In humans, defects in PAF-1  are
   responsible for  a  form  of  Zellweger  syndrome,  an  autosomal recessive
   disorder associated with peroxisomal deficiencies.
 - Xenopus XNF7 protein, a probable transcription factor.
 - Trypanosoma  protein  ESAG-8  (T-LR),   which   may   be  involved  in  the
   postranscriptional regulation  of  genes  in  VSG  expression  sites or may
   interact with adenylate cyclase to regulate its activity.
 - Drosophila proteins  Posterior Sex  Combs (Psc) and Suppressor two of zeste
   (Su(z)2). The  two proteins belong to the Polycomb group of genes needed to
   maintain the segment-specific repression of homeotic selector genes.
 - Drosophila  protein  male-specific  msl-2,  a  DNA-binding protein which is
   involved in   X   chromosome   dosage   compensation   (the   elevation  of
   transcription of the male single X chromosome).
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  protein  COP1 which is involved in the regulation of
   photomorphogenesis.
 - Fungal DNA repair proteins RAD5, RAD16, RAD18 and rad8.
 - Herpesviruses trans-acting transcriptional protein ICP0/IE110. This protein
   which has  been  characterized  in many different herpesviruses is a trans-
   activator and/or  -repressor  of  the expression of many viral and cellular
   promoters.
 - Baculoviruses protein CG30.
 - Baculoviruses major immediate early protein (PE-38).
 - Baculoviruses immediate-early regulatory protein IE-N/IE-2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F54G8.4, R05D3.4 and T02C1.1.

* Nuclear hormones receptors DNA-binding region signature *
***********************************************************

Receptors for  steroid,  thyroid,  and retinoid hormones belong to a family of
nuclear trans-acting  transcriptional  regulatory  factors  [1  to  6,E1].  In
vertebrates, these  proteins  regulate  diverse  biological  processes such as
pattern formation,   cellular   differentiation   and   homeostasis.  Proteins
currently known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Androgen receptor (AR).
 - Estrogen receptor (ER).
 - Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [E2].
 - Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) [E3].
 - Progesterone receptor (PR).
 - Retinoic acid receptors (RARs and RXRs).
 - Thyroid hormone receptors (TR) alpha and beta [E4].
 - The  avian  erythroblastosis virus oncogene v-erbA, derived from a cellular
   thyroid hormone receptor.
 - Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR).
 - Insects ecdysone receptor (EcR).
 - COUP transcription  factor  (also  known  as  ear-3),  and  its  Drosophila
   homolog seven-up (svp).
 - Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), which binds  to DNA sites required for
   the transcription of the genes for alpha-1-antitrypsin, apolipoprotein CIII
   and transthyretin.
 - Ad4BP, a protein that binds to the Ad4 site found in the promoter region of
   steroidogenic P450 genes.
 - Apolipoprotein   AI   regulatory   protein-1   (ARP-1),  required  for  the
   transcription of apolipoprotein AI.
 - Peroxisome  proliferator  activated receptors (PPAR), transcription factors
   specifically activated   by  peroxisome  proliferators.  They  control  the
   peroxisomal beta-oxidation  pathway  of  fatty acids by activating the gene
   for acyl-CoA oxidase.
 - Drosophila  protein  knirps  (kni),  a  zygotic  gap  protein  required for
   abdominal segmentation of the Drosophila embryo.
 - Drosophila protein  ultraspiracle (usp) (or chorion factor 1),  which binds
   to the promoter region of s15 chorion gene.

As well as a number of proteins whose function is not yet known:

 - Human estrogen receptor related genes 1 and 2 (err1 and err2).
 - Human erbA related gene 2 (ear-2).
 - Mammalian NGFI-B (NAK1, nur/77, N10).
 - Mammalian NOT/nurR1/RNR-1.
 - Drosophila protein embryonic gonad (egon).
 - Drosophila knirps-related protein (knrl).
 - Drosophila protein tailless (tll).
 - Drosophila 20-oh-ecdysone regulated protein E75.
 - Insects Hr3.
 - Insects Hr38.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans cnr-8, cnr-14, and odr-7
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins B0280.8, EO2H1.7 and K06A1.4.

These proteins  all share a conserved cysteine-rich DNA-binding region of some
65 residues.  This  region has been predicted to fold into two 'C4'-type  zinc
fingers.  A consensus representation of the DNA-binding domain is shown in the
following figure:

   <----Zinc-finger---->               <------Zinc-Finger------>

As a signature pattern for this family of proteins, we took the most conserved
residues, the first 27, of the DNA-binding domain.

* GATA-type zinc finger domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

The GATA family of transcription factors are proteins  that bind  to DNA sites
with the consensus sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G), found within the regulatory region
of a number of genes. Proteins currently known to belong to this family are:

 - GATA-1 [1] (also known as Eryf1, GF-1 or NF-E1),  which  binds  to the GATA
   region of globin genes and other genes expressed in erythroid cells.  It is
   a transcriptional  activator  which   probably serves as a general 'switch'
   factor for erythroid development.
 - GATA-2 [2], a transcriptional activator which  regulates  endothelin-1 gene
   expression in endothelial cells.
 - GATA-3 [3], a transcriptional activator which  binds to the enhancer of the
   T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes.
 - GATA-4 [4], a transcriptional  activator  expressed in endodermally derived
   tissues and heart.
 - Drosophila protein pannier (or DGATAa) (gene pnr) which acts as a repressor
   of the achaete-scute complex (as-c).
 - Bombyx mori BCFI [5], which regulates the expression of chorion genes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans elt-1 and elt-2, transcriptional activators of genes
   containing the GATA region, including vitellogenin genes [6].
 - Ustilago  maydis  urbs1  [7],  a  protein involved in the repression of the
   biosynthesis of siderophores.
 - Fission yeast protein GAF2.

All these transcription factors contain a pair of highly similar 'zinc finger'
type domains with the consensus sequence C-x2-C-x17-C-x2-C.

Some other proteins contain a single zinc finger motif highly related to those
of the GATA transcription factors. These proteins are:

 - Drosophila  box A-binding factor (ABF) (also known as protein serpent (gene
   srp)) which  may  function  as  a transcriptional activator protein and may
   play a key role in the organogenesis of the fat body.
 - Emericella nidulans areA [8], a  transcriptional  activator  which mediates
   nitrogen metabolite repression.
 - Neurospora crassa nit-2 [9], a transcriptional activator which turns on the
   expression of genes coding for enzymes required for the use of a variety of
   secondary nitrogen sources, during conditions of nitrogen limitation.
 - Neurospora  crassa  white  collar  proteins  1 and 2 (WC-1 and WC-2), which
   control expression of light-regulated genes.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAL81 (or UGA43), a  negative  nitrogen regulatory
   protein.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GLN3, a positive nitrogen regulatory protein.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAT1 to GAT4.
 - Saccharomyces cerevisiae GZF3.

**************************************************

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30) (PARP) [1,2] is a  eukaryotic enzyme
that catalyzes  the  covalent  attachment  of ADP-ribose  units from NAD(+) to
various nuclear  acceptor  proteins.  This  post-translational modification of
nuclear  proteins  is  dependent  on  DNA.  It  appears  to be involved in the
regulation of various  important  cellular  processes such as differentiation,
proliferation and  tumor  transformation  as  well as in the regulation of the
molecular events involved in the recovery of the cell from DNA damage.

Structurally, PARP,  about  1000  amino-acids residues long, consists of three
distinct domains:  an  N-terminal zinc-dependent DNA-binding domain, a central
automodification domain and a C-terminal NAD-binding domain.

The DNA-binding region  contains a pair of zinc finger domains which have been
shown to  bind DNA in a zinc-dependent manner. The zinc finger domains of PARP
seem to bind specifically to single-stranded DNA.

DNA ligase  III  [3]  contains,  in its N-terminal section, a single copy of a
zinc finger highly similar to those of PARP.

A number of fungal transcriptional activator proteins contain a  cysteine-rich
region that  binds  DNA  in  a zinc-dependent fashion. It has been shown [1,2]
that this  region forms a binuclear zinc cluster where six conserved cysteines
bind two  zinc  cations.  Proteins  known  to contain such a domain are listed

* Copper-fist domain *

Some fungal  transcription  factors  contains  a N-terminal domain which seems
to be involved in copper-dependent DNA-binding [1,2].  Such a  domain,  called
"copper-fist" seem  to  undergo a conformational change in presence of copper.
The proteins that are known to contain such a domain are:

 - Yeast ACE1 (or CUP2), which regulates the expression of the metallothionein
   gene (CUP1).
 - Candida   glabrata   AMT1,   which   also   regulates   the  expression  of
   metallothionein genes (MT-I and MT-II).
 - Yeast  MAC1  (CUA1),  a  regulator  of  the expression of the FRE1 and CTT1
   (catalase) genes.
 - Yarrowia lipolytica copper resistance protein CRF1.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC31A2.11c.

The signature  pattern  we  developed  spans the complete length of the domain
and includes  three  cysteines  and  two histidines that are probably involved
in copper-binding.

* Leucine zipper pattern *
**************************

A structure,  referred to as the 'leucine zipper' [1,2], has been proposed  to
explain  how some eukaryotic gene regulatory proteins work. The leucine zipper
consist  of a  periodic  repetition  of  leucine  residues  at  every  seventh
position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The segments containing
these  periodic  arrays of leucine residues seem to exist in  an alpha-helical
conformation. The leucine side chains extending from one alpha-helix  interact
with those  from a similar alpha helix  of  a second polypeptide, facilitating
dimerization; the structure formed by cooperation of these two regions forms a
coiled coil [3]. The leucine zipper pattern is present in many gene regulatory
proteins, such as:

 - The CCATT-box and enhancer binding protein (C/EBP).
 - The cAMP response element (CRE) binding proteins (CREB, CRE-BP1, ATFs).
 - The Jun/AP1 family of transcription factors.
 - The yeast general control protein GCN4.
 - The fos oncogene, and the fos-related proteins fra-1 and fos B.
 - The C-myc, L-myc and N-myc oncogenes.
 - The octamer-binding transcription factor 2 (Oct-2/OTF-2).

-Consensus pattern: L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L-x(6)-L
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: All    those
 mentioned in the original paper, with the exception of L-myc which  has a Met

-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: some 600 other sequences from every
 category of protein families.

-Note: as this is far from being a specific  pattern you should be cautious in
 citing the presence of such pattern in a protein  if it has not been shown to
 be a nuclear DNA-binding protein.

The bZIP superfamily [1,2,E1] of eukaryotic DNA-binding  transcription factors
groups together  proteins  that  contain  a  basic  region mediating sequence-
specific DNA-binding  followed  by a leucine zipper (see <PDOC00029>) required
for dimerization.  This  family  is  quite  large  and  we only list here some
representative members.

 - Transcription factor AP-1, which binds  selectively to enhancer elements in
   the cis control regions of SV40 and metallothionein IIA.   AP-1, also known
   as c-jun, is  the  cellular  homolog  of the avian sarcoma virus 17 (ASV17)
   oncogene v-jun.
 - Jun-B and jun-D,  probable transcription factors which  are  highly similar
   to jun/AP-1.
 - The fos protein, a  proto-oncogene  that  forms  a  non-covalent dimer with
   c-jun.
 - The fos-related proteins fra-1, and fos B.
 - Mammalian  cAMP  response element (CRE) binding proteins CREB, CREM, ATF-1,
   ATF-3, ATF-4, ATF-5, ATF-6 and LRF-1.
 - Maize  Opaque  2,  a trans-acting transcriptional activator involved in the
   regulation of the production of zein proteins during endosperm.
 - Arabidopsis G-box binding factors  GBF1 to GBF4,  Parsley CPRF-1 to CPRF-3,
   Tobacco TAF-1 and wheat EMBP-1. All these  proteins bind the G-box promoter
   elements of many plant genes.
 - Drosophila  protein  Giant,  which  represses  the  expression  of both the
   kruppel and knirps segmentation gap genes.
 - Drosophila Box B binding factor 2 (BBF-2), a transcriptional activator that
   binds to  fat  body-specific  enhancers  of  alcohol dehydrogenase and yolk
   protein genes.
 - Drosophila segmentation protein cap'n'collar (gene cnc),  which is involved
   in head morphogenesis.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans skn-1, a developmental protein involved in the fate
   of ventral blastomeres in the early embryo.
 - Yeast GCN4 transcription factor, a component of  the general control system
   that  regulates  the  expression of  amino  acid-synthesizing   enzymes  in
   response to amino acid  starvation, and the related Neurospora crassa cpc-1
   protein.

* Myb DNA-binding domain repeat signatures and profile *
********************************************************

The retroviral oncogene v-myb , and  its  cellular  counterpart c-myb,  encode
nuclear  DNA-binding  proteins  that  specifically   recognize  the   sequence
YAAC(G/T)G [1]. The myb family also includes the following proteins:

 - Drosophila D-myb [2].
 - Vertebrate myb-like proteins A-myb and B-myb [3].
 - Maize C1 protein, a trans-acting factor which  controls  the  expression of
   genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
 - Maize P protein [4], a trans-acting factor which regulates the biosynthetic
   pathway of a flavonoid-derived pigment in certain floral tissues.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  protein  GL1  [5],  required  for  the initiation of
   differentiation of leaf hair cells (trichomes).
 - A  number  of  myb/c1-related proteins in maize and barley, whose roles are
   not yet known [4].
 - Yeast BAS1 [7], a transcriptional activator for the HIS4 gene.
 - Yeast REB1 [8], which recognizes sites  within  both  the  enhancer and the
   promoter  of  rRNA  transcription,  as  well  as  upstream  of  many  genes
   transcribed by RNA polymerase II.
 - Fission  yeast  cdc5,  a  possible  transcription  factor whose activity is
   required for cell cycle progression and growth during G2.
 - Fission yeast myb1, which regulates telomere length and function.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YMR213w.

One of the most conserved  regions in all of these proteins is a domain of 160
amino acids.  It consists of three tandem repeats of 51 to 53 amino acids.  In
myb, this repeat region has been shown [9] to be involved in DNA-binding.

The major part  of  the first repeat  is missing in retroviral v-myb sequences
and in plant myb-related proteins.  Yeast REB1 differs from the other proteins
in this family in having a single myb-like domain.

As shown in the following  schematic  representation,  we  have  developed two
signature patterns   for  myb-like  domains;  the  first  is  located  in  the
N-terminal section, the second spans the C-terminal extremity of the domain. A
profile was developed that spans the myb-like domain.

**************************************************************
* Myc-type, 'helix-loop-helix' dimerization domain signature *
**************************************************************

A number of  eukaryotic proteins,  which probably  are sequence specific  DNA-
binding proteins that act as transcription  factors,  share a conserved domain
of 40 to 50 amino acid residues.  It has been proposed [1] that this domain is
formed  of two amphipathic helices  joined by  a variable length linker region
that could form a loop.  This 'helix-loop-helix' (HLH) domain mediates protein
dimerization and has been found in the proteins listed below [2,3,E1,E2]. Most
of these  proteins  have an extra basic region of about 15 amino acid residues
that is  adjacent  to  the HLH domain and specifically binds to  DNA. They are
refered as  basic helix-loop-helix  proteins (bHLH), and are classified in two
groups: class  A  (ubiquitous)  and  class B (tissue-specific). Members of the
bHLH family  bind variations on the core sequence 'CANNTG', also refered to as
the E-box motif. The homo- or heterodimerization mediated by the HLH domain is
independent of,  but  necessary  for  DNA  binding,  as  two basic regions are
required for  DNA  binding activity. The HLH proteins lacking the basic domain
(Emc, Id)  function  as  negative regulators since they form heterodimers, but
fail to  bind  DNA.  The  hairy-related proteins (hairy, E(spl), deadpan) also
repress transcription  although    they  can  bind  DNA.  The proteins of this
subfamily act together with co-repressor proteins, like groucho, through their
C-terminal motif WRPW. 

 - The myc family  of cellular oncogenes [4],  which  is  currently  known  to
   contain four  members:  c-myc  [E3], N-myc, L-myc, and B-myc. The myc genes
   are thought to play a role in cellular differentiation and proliferation.
 - Proteins involved in myogenesis (the induction of muscle cells). In mammals
   MyoD1 (Myf-3),  myogenin (Myf-4),  Myf-5, and  Myf-6 (Mrf4 or herculin), in
   birds CMD1 (QMF-1), in  Xenopus MyoD and MF25,  in  Caenorhabditis  elegans
   CeMyoD, and in Drosophila nautilus (nau).
 - Vertebrate proteins that bind specific DNA sequences ('E boxes') in various
   immunoglobulin  chains  enhancers: E2A or ITF-1 (E12/pan-2 and  E47/pan-1),
   ITF-2 (tcf4), TFE3, and TFEB.
 - Vertebrate neurogenic differentiation factor 1 that acts as differentiation
   factor during neurogenesis.
 - Vertebrate MAX  protein, a  transcription regulator  that forms a sequence-
   specific DNA-binding protein complex with myc or mad.
 - Vertebrate   Max  Interacting  Protein  1 (MXI1  protein)  which  acts as a

* p53 family signature *
************************

The p53 tumor antigen [1 to 5, E1,E2] is a protein  found in increased amounts
in a  wide  variety  of  transformed  cells.  It  is  also  detectable in many
proliferating nontransformed  cells,  but it is undetectable or present at low
levels in resting cells. It is frequently mutated or inactivated in many types
of cancer.  p53  seems  to act as a tumor suppressor in some, but probably not
all, tumor  types.  p53 is probably involved in cell cycle regulation, and may
be a  trans-activator  that  acts  to negatively regulate cellular division by
controlling a set of genes required for this process.

p53 is a phosphoprotein of about 390 amino acids which  can be subdivided into
four domains: a highly charged acidic region  of  about 75  to  80 residues, a
hydrophobic proline-rich  domain (position 80 to 150), a  central region (from
150 to about 300),  and a highly basic C-terminal region.  The sequence of p53
is well conserved in vertebrate species;  attempts  to  identify  p53 in other
eukaryotic philum has so far been unsuccessful.

The p53 protein belongs to a family [6] that also includes:

 - p51 (p63 or Ket), a transcriptional activator.
 - p73,  a  transcriptional  activator  that  participates  in  the  apoptotic
   response to DNA damage.

As a  signature  pattern for this family we selected a conserved stretch of 13
residues located in the central region of the protein.   This region, known as
domain IV in [3], is involved (along  with an adjacent region)  in the binding
of the large T antigen of SV40.  In man this region is the focus  of a variety
of point mutations in cancerous tumors.

* CBF/NF-Y subunits signatures *
********************************

Diverse DNA binding  proteins are  known  to bind the CCAAT box, a common cis-
acting element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of a large number of
genes in  eukaryotes. Amongst these proteins is one known as the CCAAT-binding
factor (CBF)  or  NF-Y [1].  CBF  is  a heteromeric transcription  factor that
consists of two different components both needed for DNA-binding.

The HAP  protein  complex  of  yeast  binds to the upstream activation site of
cytochrome C   iso-1   gene   (CYC1)  as  well  as  other  genes  involved  in
mitochondrial electron  transport  and  activates  their  expression.  It also
recognizes the  sequence CCAAT and is structurally and evolutionary related to
CBF.

The first    subunit   of CBF, known as CBF-A or NF-YB in vertebrates, HAP3 in
budding yeast and as php3 in fission yeast, is a protein  of 116 to 210 amino-
acid residues  which  contains  a  highly conserved central domain of about 90
residues. This domain seems to be involved in DNA-binding; we have developed a
signature pattern from its central part.

The second  subunit  of  CBF,  known as CBF-B or NF-YA in vertebrates, HAP2 in
budding yeast and php2 in fission yeast, is a protein of 265 to 350 amino-acid
residues which  contains a highly conserved region of about 60 residues.  This
region, called  the  'essential core' [2], seems to consist of two subdomains:
an N-terminal  subunit-association  domain  and  a  C-terminal DNA recognition
domain.  We  have developed a signature pattern from a section of the subunit-
association domain.

* COE family signature *
************************

The independent cloning of rodent EBF/Olf-1 and Drosophila Collier has defined
a family of transcription factors, the Collier or COE family [1]. COE proteins
have various  functions  in  different  organisms. Proteins currently known to
belong to this family are listed below:

 - Mammalian  COE1  (OLF-1;  EBF-1; OE-1), COE2 (EBF-2; OE-3) and COE3 (EBF-3;
   OE-2).
 - Xenopus XCOE2 and XCOE3.
 - Zebrafish ZCOE2.
 - Drosophila Collier.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-3.

In mouse,  COE1 has a role in B-cell differentiation, and could also perform a
role in  neuronal  differentiation.  All  three  COE are expressed in immature
olfactory neuronal  precursors  and  mature  olfactory  neurons  as well as in
developping nervous system during embryogenesis.

In Drosophila,  Collier  is involved in the formation of the embryonic somatic
muscle DA3,  in  the  patterning  of  the wing by mediating Hedgehog activity.
It could  also  act as a second-level regulator in the patterning of embryonic
head.

In Xenopus, XCOE2  is expressed in precursors of primary neurons, and may play
a pivotal  role  in  the transcriptional cascade specifying primary neurons in
embryo. It promotes neuronal differentiation by activating XNeuroD expression.

In Zebrafish, ZCOE2  is  expressed  in  a subset of primary neuroblasts in the
spinal cord and at later stages is a marker of the olfactory placodes.

Caenorhabditis elegans mutants for UNC-3 move abnormally suggesting that UNC-3
might regulate expression of genes involved in growth cone pioneering long the
ventral cord or in fasciculation.

As a  signature  for  these proteins we selected a conserved region located in
a domain  thought  to be part of the DNA-binding region. The signature pattern
includes four conserved cysteines that could be part of a zinc-finger motif.

* 'Cold-shock' domain signature *
*********************************

A conserved domain of about 70 amino acids  has  been found in prokaryotic and
eukaryotic single-strand   nucleic-acid   binding  proteins  [1,2,3,E1].  This
domain, which  is  known  as  the  'cold-shock domain' (CSD) is present in the
proteins listed below.

 - Escherichia coli protein CS7.4 (gene cspA) which  is induced in response to
   low temperature (cold-shock protein) and which binds  to and stimulates the
   transcription of the CCAAT-containing promoters of the HN-S  protein and of
   gyrA.
 - Mammalian Y box binding protein 1 (YB1). A protein that binds to the CCAAT-
   containing Y box of mammalian HLA class II genes.
 - Xenopus Y box binding proteins -1 and -2 (Y1 and Y2). Proteins that bind to
   the CCAAT-containing Y box of Xenopus hsp70 genes.
 - Xenopus B box binding protein (YB3). YB3 binds the B  box  promoter element
   of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.
 - Enhancer factor I subunit A (EFI-A) (dbpB).  A  protein  that  also bind to
   CCAAT-motif in various gene promoters.
 - DbpA, a Human DNA-binding protein of unknown specificity.
 - Bacillus subtilis cold-shock proteins cspB and cspC.
 - Streptomyces clavuligerus protein SC 7.0.
 - Escherichia coli proteins cspB, cspC, cspD, cspE and cspF.
 - Unr, a mammalian gene encoded upstream of the N-ras gene. Unr contains nine
   repeats that are similar to the CSD domain.  The function of Unr is not yet
   known but it could be a multivalent DNA-binding protein.

As a signature pattern  for the CSD domain  we  selected  its  most  conserved
region which is located in its N-terminal section.  It  must be noted that the
beginning of this region is highly similar [4] to the RNP-1 RNA-binding motif.

-Consensus pattern: [FY]-G-F-I-x(6,7)-[DER]-[LIVM]-F-x-H-x-[STKR]-x-[LIVMFY]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for E.coli cspF.  This pattern finds 4 out of the 9 repeats of the CSD domain
 in Unr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: GRP-2, a glycine-rich  protein from
 tobacco, the N-terminal part of this protein is strikingly similar to the CSD
 domain.

**********************
* CTF/NF-I signature *
**********************

Nuclear factor I (NF-I) or CCAAT box-binding transcription factor  (CTF) [1,2]
(also known   as  TGGCA-binding  proteins)  are a family of vertebrate nuclear
proteins  which  recognize  and bind,  as dimers, the palindromic DNA sequence
5'-TTGGCNNNNNGCCAA-3'. CTF/NF-I    binding  sites  are  present  in  viral and
cellular promoters and in the origin of DNA replication of Adenovirus type 2.

The CTF/NF-I  proteins were first identified as nuclear factor I, a collection
of proteins  that  activate  the  replication  of several Adenovirus serotypes
(together with  NF-II  and  NF-III)  [3].  The  family  of  proteins  was also
identified as  the  CTF transcription factors, before the NFI and CTF families
were found to be identical [4]. The CTF/NF-I proteins are individually capable
of activating  transcription and DNA replication. The CTF/NF-I family name has
also been dubbed as NFI, NF-I or NF1.

In a given species, there  are a  large number of different CTF/NF-I proteins.
The multiplicity  of  CTF/NF-I  is  known  to be generated both by alternative
splicing and  by  the  occurrence  of four different genes. The known forms of
NF-I genes have been classified as:

 - The CTF-like factors subfamily (prototype form: CTF-1) [4]
 - The NFI-X proteins.
 - The NFI-A proteins.
 - The NFI-B proteins.

So far,  all  CTF/NF-I family members appear to have similar transcription and
replication activities.

CTF/NF-1 proteins contains 400 to 600 amino acids.  The N-terminal  200 amino-
acid sequence,  almost perfectly conserved in all species and genes sequenced,
mediates site-specific  DNA  recognition,  protein dimerization and Adenovirus
DNA replication.  The  C-terminal  100 amino acids contain the transcriptional
activation domain.  This  activation  domain  is the target of gene expression
regulatory pathways  ellicited  by  growth factors and it interacts with basal
transcription factors and with histone H3 [6].

As a specific signature  for this  family of proteins, we selected a perfectly
conserved, highly charged 12 residue peptide located in the N-terminal part of
CTF/NF-I.

* Ets-domain signatures and profile *
*************************************

Avian leukemia virus E26 is a replication defective  retrovirus that induces a
mixed erythroid/myeloid leukemia in chickens.  E26 virus  carries two distinct
oncogenes, v-myb and v-ets.  The ets portion  of this oncogene is required for
the induction of erythroblastosis. V-ets and c-ets-1, its cellular progenitor,
have been shown [1] to be nuclear DNA-binding proteins. Ets-1 differs slightly
from v-ets at its carboxy-terminal region.   In most species where it has been
sequenced, c-ets-1   exists  in  various  isoforms  generated  by  alternative
splicing and differential phosphorylation.

A number  of  proteins,  that  share regions of similarity with v-ets/c-ets-1,
have been found and are listed below:

 - Ets-2,  which  has  been   sequenced  in  mammals,  chicken,  Xenopus   and
   Drosophila.
 - Human ELF-1, a transcription factor that appears to be  required for the T-
   cell-receptor-mediated trans activation of HIV-2 genes.
 - Mammalian   ELK-1, ELK-3 (also known as Net or SAP-2) and ELK-4 (also known
   as SRF  accessory protein 1 (SAP-1)), which all form a ternary complex with
   the serum response factor (SRF).
 - Human  ERF, a potent transcriptional repressor that binds to the HI element
   of the Ets-2 promoter.
 - Human ERG.
 - Human ERM.
 - Mammalian ETV1, a transcriptional activator.
 - FLI-1, a sequence specific transcriptional activator.
 - Adenovirus E1A enhancer-binding protein (E1A-F) (ETV4) (PEA3).
 - PU.1 (also known as Spi-1), a protein that binds to a purine-rich sequence,
   the PU-box, that can act as a lymphoid-specific enhancer.  PU.1 is probably
   a transcriptional  activator  that  may  be  specifically  involved  in the
   differentiation or activation of macrophages or B cells. In mouse, Spi-1 is
   an oncogene involved in murine acute friend erythroleukemia.
 - Spi-B, a transcription factor that binds the PU-box.
 - GA binding protein (GAPB) alpha subunit.  GAPB  is  a  transcription factor
   capable of interacting with purine-rich repeats (GA repeats).
 - Drosophila protein elg-1.
 - Drosophila  protein  pokkuri (pok) (also known as yan), which is a negative
   regulator of photoreceptor development.
 - Drosophila  protein pointed (pnt) which is required for glial-neuronal cell
   interactions.
 - Drosophila ecdysone induced protein 74E.

All these  proteins  contain  a  conserved domain, the 'ETS-domain', [2,3,4,5]
involved in    DNA-binding. It seems to  recognize  purine-rich sequences [5].
This domain, of about 85 to 90 amino acids, is rich in aromatic and positively
charged residues.  It is generally localized at the C-terminus of the protein,
with the  exception of ELF-1, ELK-1, ELK-3, ELK-4 and ERF where it is found at
the N-terminus.

We have derived two signature patterns for the ETS-domain.  The  first  one is
based on a highly conserved region in the N-terminal part of the domain, while
the second is based on a region in the second third of the domain. The profile
spans the complete domain.

conserved  domain of    about  100  amino-acid  residues, called the fork head
domain (but also known as a "winged helix"), which is  involved in DNA-binding
[2]. Proteins known to contain this domain are listed below.

 - Drosophila fork head protein (fkh). Fkh is probably a transcription  factor
   that regulates the expression of genes involved in terminal development.
 - Drosophila  protein  crocodile  (gene  croc) [3], which is required for the
   establishment of head structures.
 - Drosophila proteins FD2, FD3, FD4, and FD5.
 - Drosophila  proteins  sloppy  paired  1  and  2 (slp1 and slp2) involved in
   segmentation.
 - Bombyx  mori  silk  gland factor-1 (SGF-1) which regulates transcription of
   the sericim-1 gene.
 - Mammalian  transcriptional  activators  HNF-3-alpha, -beta, and -gamma. The
   HNF-3 proteins interact with the cis-acting  regulatory regions of a number
   of liver genes.
 - Mammalian  interleukin-enhancer  binding  factor  (ILF).  ILF  binds to the
   purine-rich NFAT-like  motifs  in  the  HIV-1  LTR  and  the  interleukin-2
   promoter.  ILF may be involved in both  positive and negative regulation of
   important viral and cellular promoter elements.
 - Mammalian  transcription  factor  BF-1 which plays an important role in the
   establishment  of  the regional subdivision of the developing brain and  in
   the development of the telencephalon.
 - Human HTLF, a protein that binds  to the purine-rich region in human T-cell
   leukemia virus long terminal repeat (HTLV-I LTR).
 - Mammalian  transcription  factors  FREAC-1 (FKHL5, HFH-8), FREAC-2 (FKHL6),
   FREAC-3 (FKHL7,  FKH-1),  FREAC-4  (FKHL8),  FREAC-5 (FKHL9, FKH-2, HFH-6),
   FREAC-6 (FKHL10,  HFH-5), FREAC-7 (FKHL11), FREAC-8 (FKHL12, HFH-7), FKH-3,
   FKH-4, FKH-5, HFH-1 and HFH-4.
 - Human  AFX1  which  is  involved in a chromosomal translocation that causes
   acute leukemia.
 - Human  FKHR  which  is  involved in a chromosomal translocation that causes
   rhabdomyosarcoma.
 - Xenopus XFKH1, a protein essential for normal axis formation.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  lin-31;  involved in the regulation of vulval cell
   fates.
 - Yeast HCM1, a protein of unknown function.
 - Yeast FKH1.
 - Yeast FKH2.

The fork domain is highly conserved.  We have  developed  two patterns for its
detection. The  first corresponds to the N-terminal section of the domain; the
second is a heptapeptide located in the central section of the domain.

* HSF-type DNA-binding domain signature *
*****************************************

Heat shock factor (HSF) is a DNA-binding protein  that specifically binds heat
shock  promoter  elements (HSE).  HSE  is  a  palindromic  element  rich  with
repetitive purine and  pyrimidine motifs:  5'-nGAAnnTTCnnGAAnnTTCn-3'.  HSF is
expressed at normal  temperatures but is  activated  by heat shock or chemical
stressors [1,2]. The sequences  of  HSF  from  various  species show extensive
similarity in  a  region  of about 90 amino acids, which has been shown [3] to
bind DNA.

Some other proteins also contain a HSF domain, these are:

 - Yeast  SFL1,  a protein involved in cell surface assembly and regulation of
   the gene related to flocculation (asexual cell aggregation) [4].
 - Yeast  transcription  factor  SKN7  (or  BRY1  or POS9), which binds to the
   promoter elements  SCB  and  MCB  essential  for the controal of G1 cyclins
   expression [5].
 - Yeast MGA1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR147w.

We have  derived a pattern from the most conserved part of the HSF DNA-binding
domain, its central region.

* Tryptophan pentad repeat (IRF family) signature *
***************************************************

Viral infections induce  the  expression  of type I interferons (IFN-alpha and
IFN-beta) genes. The induction is due to the transcriptional activation of the
IFN genes.  Interferon regulatory factor I (IRF-1) is one of the transcription
factors responsible for that activation. IRF-1 binds to an upstream regulatory
cis element, known as the interferon consensus sequence (ICS),  which is found
in the promoters of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I genes. Interferon
regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2) is a protein that also interacts with the ICS, but
that does not function as an activator;  rather, it suppresses the function of
IRF-1 under certain circumstances [1].

These proteins  share  a highly conserved N-terminal domain of about 100 amino
acid residues  which  is  involved  in  DNA-binding  and  which  contain  five
conserved tryptophan. This domain is known as a 'tryptophan pentad repeat' and
is also present in:

 - Interferon consensus sequence binding protein (ICSBP) [2],  a transcription
   factor expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissues and induced by IFN-gamma
   that also binds to the ICS.
 - Transcriptional regulator ISGF3 gamma subunit [3]. ISGF3 is responsible for
   the initial stimulation of interferon-alpha-responsive genes. It recognizes
   and binds to  the interferon-stimulated  response element (ISRE) within the
   regulatory sequences of target genes.
 - Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3).
 - Interferon  regulatory  factor  4  (IRF-4)  which  binds to the interferon-
   stimulated response element (ISRE) of the MHC class I promoter.
 - Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5).
 - Interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF-6).
 - Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7).

As a    signature  for this domain, we selected the region that spans from the
second to the fourth of the five conserved tryptophans.

* LIM domain signature and profile *
************************************

Recently [1,2] a number of proteins have  been  found  to  contain a conserved
cysteine-rich domain of about 60 amino-acid residues. These proteins are:

 - Caenorhabditis elegans mec-3; a protein required for the differentiation of
   the set of six touch receptor neurons in this nematode.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  lin-11;  a  protein  required  for  the asymmetric
   division of vulval blast cells.
 - Vertebrate insulin gene enhancer binding protein isl-1.  Isl-1 binds to one
   of the two cis-acting protein-binding domains of the insulin gene.
 - Vertebrate homeobox proteins lim-1, lim-2 (lim-5) and lim3.
 - Vertebrate  lmx-1,  which acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to
   the FLAT  element;  a  beta-cell-specific transcriptional enhancer found in
   the insulin gene.
 - Mammalian  LH-2,  a  transcriptional  regulatory  protein  involved  in the
   control of  cell  differentiation  in  developing  lymphoid and neural cell
   types.
 - Drosophila  protein  apterous,  required  for the normal development of the
   wing and halter imaginal discs.
 - Vertebrate protein kinases LIMK-1 and LIMK-2.
 - Mammalian   rhombotins. Rhombotin 1 (RBTN1 or TTG-1) and rhombotin-2 (RBTN2
   or TTG-2)  are  proteins of about 160 amino acids whose genes are disrupted
   by chromosomal translocations in T-cell leukemia.
 - Mammalian  and  avian cysteine-rich protein (CRP), a 192 amino-acid protein
   of unknown function. Seems to interact with zyxin.
 - Mammalian cysteine-rich intestinal protein (CRIP),  a  small  protein which
   seems to   have   a  role  in  zinc  absorption  and  may  function  as  an
   intracellular zinc transport protein.
 - Vertebrate paxillin, a cytoskeletal focal adhesion protein.
 - Mouse testin. Mouse testin  should not be confused with rat testin which is
   a thiol protease homolog (see <PDOC00126>).
 - Sunflower pollen specific protein SF3.
 - Chicken zyxin. Zyxin is  a low-abundance adhesion plaque protein which  has
   been shown to interact with CRP.
 - Yeast protein LRG1 which is involved in sporulation [4].
 - Yeast rho-type GTPase activating protein RGA1/DBM1.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans homeobox protein ceh-14.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans homeobox protein unc-97.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKR090w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C28H8.6.

These proteins  generally  have two tandem copies of a domain, called LIM (for
Lin-11 Isl-1  Mec-3)  in  their  N-terminal  section.  Zyxin  and paxillin are
exceptions in  that  they  contains respectively three and four LIM domains at
their C-terminal extremity. In apterous, isl-1,  LH-2, lin-11, lim-1 to lim-3,
lmx-1 and ceh-14 and mec-3 there is a homeobox domain some 50 to 95 amino acids after the
LIM domains.

In the  LIM  domain,  there  are  seven  conserved  cysteine  residues  and  a
histidine. The  arrangement followed by these conserved residues is  C-x(2)-C-
x(16,23)-H-x(2)-[CH]-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(16,21)-C-x(2,3)-[CHD]. The   LIM   domain
binds two  zinc  ions  [5].  LIM  does not bind DNA, rather it seems to act as
interface for protein-protein interaction.   We developed a pattern that spans
the first half of the LIM domain.

******************************************************
* NF-kappa-B/Rel/dorsal domain signature and profile *
******************************************************

Various studies  (reviewed  in  [1-5])  have allowed the characterization of a
family of  eukaryotic  transcription factors with basic impact on oncogenesis,
embryonic development and  differentiation including immune response and acute
phase reaction.  Most  of  these  transcription  factors bind as dimers to the
consensus DNA  sequence  motif  5'-GGGRNNYYCC-3'  termed kappa-B according the
first  described factor-binding  sequence  motif located in the immunoglobulin
kappa light chain enhancer region.

Proteins of  this  family  appear  to  be  regulated,  at  least  in  part, by
subcellular localization  whereby the inactive cytoplasmic forms become active
transcriptional  control  proteins by translocation to the nucleus. Members of
the  Rel  family  share  a highly  conserved 300 amino acids domain termed Rel
homology domain (RHD) which is located towards  the amino terminus. The unique
C-terminal is  thought  to  be  involved  in  gene  activation and cytoplasmic
anchoring functions.

Proteins known to contain a RHD domain are listed below:

 - Both subunits of vertebrate nuclear factor NF-kappa-B. The active NF-kappa-
   B is  a heterodimer of an about 50 Kd DNA-binding subunit (p50 or p49, p52)
   and the transcription factor p65.
 - Mammalian  transcription factor RelB, which stimulates promoter activity in
   the presence of the 50 Kd subunit of NF-kappa-B.
 - Vertebrate  proto-oncogene  c-rel,  a  protein  that  may  play  a  role in
   differentiation and lymphopoiesis.
 - Avian  reticuloendotheliosis  virus p58 v-rel, a transforming protein which
   induces acute leucemia in juvenile birds.
 - Drosophila    embryonic    polarity   dorsal protein.  The concentration of
   this morphogenetic  protein in the  nucleus  during  the  blastoderm  stage
   determines the lateral or ventral identity of a cell. It directly  controls
   the  expression of zygotically  active  genes crucial for development along
   this axis.
 - Drosophila  dorsal-related  immunity  factor  (gene  Dif) which mediates an
   immune response in the larvae.
 - Mammalian  nuclear  factor  of  activated  T  cells  (NFAT);  a  family  of
   transcription factors  that    play   a role in the inducible expression of
   cytokine genes in T cells.

For several  proteins  it  has  been demonstrated ([1] and references therein)
that the Rel homology domain includes:

 (1) a  DNA-binding domain, which binds to the consensus  DNA  sequence  motif
     5'-GGGRNNYYCC-3' (except  for  dorsal, which recognizes the related motif
     5'-GRGAAAANCC-3');
 (2) a  dimerization  domain,  which  is located in the C-terminal part of the
     RHD;
 (3) a PKA phosphorylation site (see <PDOC00004>) (except in RelB);
 (4) a nuclear localization signal (NLS),  which consists of a stretch of four
     or five basic residues.

As a  signature  for  this  family we selected a region that is located at the
N-terminal of the RHD. This region includes a conserved cysteine that seems to
be essential  for  DNA-binding  in  p50  [6]. We also developed a profile that
spans completly the RHD.

* MADS-box domain signature and profile *
*****************************************

A number of transcription factors  contain a conserved domain of 56 amino-acid
residues, sometimes known as the MADS-box domain [E1]. They are listed below:

 - Serum  response  factor  (SRF)  [1],  a mammalian transcription factor that
   binds to the Serum Response Element (SRE). This is a short sequence of dyad
   symmetry located 300 bp  to the 5' end of the transcription initiation site
   of genes such as c-fos.
 - Mammalian  myocyte-specific  enhancer  factors  2A  to 2D (MEF2A to MEF2D).
   These proteins  are  transcription  factor  which binds specifically to the
   MEF2 element  present  in  the  regulatory  regions of many muscle-specific
   genes.
 - Drosophila myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2).
 - Yeast  GRM/PRTF  protein  (gene  MCM1) [2], a  transcriptional regulator of
   mating-type-specific genes.
 - Yeast arginine metabolism regulation protein I (gene ARGR1 or ARG80).
 - Yeast transcription factor RLM1.
 - Yeast transcription factor SMP1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana  agamous  protein (AG) [3],  a  probable transcription
   factor  involved  in  regulating  genes  that  determines stamen and carpel
   development in wild-type flowers.   Mutations in  the AG gene result in the
   replacement of the stamens by petals and the carpels by a new flower.
 - Arabidopsis  thaliana  homeotic proteins Apetala1 (AP1), Apetala3 (AP3) and
   Pistillata (PI)  which  act  locally  to specify the identity of the floral
   meristem and to determine sepal and petal development [4].
 - Antirrhinum majus and tobacco homeotic protein deficiens (DEFA) and globosa
   (GLO) [5].  Both proteins are transcription factors involved in the genetic
   control of  flower  development.    Mutations  in  DEFA  or  GLO  cause the
   transformation of petals into sepals and of stamina into carpels.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana putative transcription factors AGL1 to AGL6 [6].
 - Antirrhinum majus morphogenetic protein DEF H33 (squamosa).

In SRF, the conserved domain has been shown [1] to  be involved in DNA-binding
and dimerization.  We have derived a pattern that spans the complete length of
the domain. The profile also spans the length of the MADS-box.

* T-box domain signatures and profile *
***************************************

A number  of  eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins contain a domain of about 170 to
190 amino acids known as the T-box domain [1,2,3] and which probably binds DNA.
The T-box  has  first  been  found  in the mice T locus (Brachyury) protein, a
transcription factor involved in mesoderm differentiation. It  has  since been
found in the following proteins:

 - Vertebrate and invertebrate homologs of the T protein.
 - Mammalian proteins TBX1 to TBX20.
 - Mammalian protein TBR1 which is expressed specifically in brain.
 - Mammalian and Xenopus laevis eomesodermin (eomes or TBR2).
 - Xenopus laevis Vegt (or Antipodean), a transcription factor that activates
   the expression of wnt-8, eomes and Brachyury.
 - Chicken TbxT.
 - Drosophila protein optomotor-blind (omb).
 - Drosophila  protein  brachyenteron  (byn)  (also  known  as  Trg), which is
   required for the specification of the hindgut and anal pads.
 - Drosophila protein H15.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans proteins tbx-1 to tbx-12.

As signature patterns for the T-domain, we selected two conserved regions. The
first region corresponds to the N-terminal of the domain and the second one to
the central part. A profile that spans the complete domain was also developed.

* TEA domain signature *
************************

The TEA  domain  [1,E1]  is a DNA-binding region of about 66 to 68 amino acids
which has  been  found  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the following nuclear
regulatory proteins:

 - Mammalian enhancer factor TEF-1. TEF-1 can bind to two  distinct  sequences
   in the SV40 enhancer and is a transcriptional activator.
 - Mammalian  TEF-3,  TEF-4 and TEF-5 [2], putative transcriptional activators
   highly similar to TEF-1.
 - Drosophila scalloped protein (gene sd),  a  probable  transcription  factor
   that functions in the regulation  of cell-specific gene  expression  during
   Drosophila development, particularly  in the differentiation of the nervous
   system [3].
 - Emericella nidulans  regulatory  protein  abaA.  AbaA  is  involved  in the
   regulation  of conidiation (asexual spore);  its expression  leads  to  the
   cessation of vegetative growth.
 - Yeast trans-acting factor TEC1.  TEC1  is involved in the activation of the
   Ty1 retrotransposon.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F28B12.2.

As a signature pattern, we have used positions 39 to 67 of the TEA domain.

***********************************************
* Transcription factor TFIIB repeat signature *
***********************************************

In eukaryotes the initiation  of  transcription  of protein  encoding genes by
polymerase II is modulated by general and specific transcription factors.  The
general transcription  factors operate through common promoters elements (such
as the TATA box). At  least  seven  different  proteins associates to form the
general  transcription factors:  TFIIA, -IIB, -IID, -IIE, -IIF, -IIG, and -IIH
[1].

Transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) plays a central role in the  transcription of
class II genes,  it  associates  with  a complex of TFIID-IIA bound to DNA (DA
complex) to form a  ternary  complex TFIID-IIA-IBB (DAB complex) which is then
recognized by RNA polymerase II [2,3].  TFIIB is a protein of about 315 to 340
amino acid residues which contains, in its C-terminal part an imperfect repeat
of a domain of about 75 residues.  This  repeat could contribute an element of
symmetry to the folded protein.

The following proteins have been shown to be evolutionary related to TFIIB:

 - An  archaebacterial TFIIB  homolog.  In   Pyrococcus  woesei  a  previously
   undetected  open reading  frame   has  been shown [4] to be  highly related
   to TFIIB.
 - Fungal transcription factor IIIB  70 Kd  subunit  (gene PCF4/TDS4/BRF1) [5].
   This protein  is a general activator  of  RNA polymerase III  transcription
   and plays a role analogous to that of TFIIB in pol III transcription.

As a signature pattern we selected the central section of the repeated domain,
which is the most conserved part of that domain.

* Transcription factor TFIID repeat signature *
***********************************************

Transcription factor TFIID  (or TATA-binding protein, TBP) [1,2] is a  general
factor  that  plays  a  major  role  in  the  activation  of  eukaryotic genes
transcribed by RNA polymerase II.   TFIID binds specifically  to  the TATA box
promoter element which lies close to the position of transcription initiation.

There is a remarkable degree of sequence  conservation of  a C-terminal domain
of about 180 residues in TFIID from various eukaryotic sources. This region is
necessary and sufficient for TATA box binding. The most significant structural
feature of this domain is the presence of two conserved repeats of a 77 amino-
acid region. The intramolecular symmetry  generates a saddle-shaped  structure
that sits astride the DNA [3].

Drosophila TRF (TBP-related factor) [4] is  a  sequence-specific transcription
factor that also binds to the TATA box and is highly similar to TFIID.

Archaebacteria also possess a TBP homolog [5].

We have derived a signature pattern  that  spans  the  last 50 residues of the
repeated region.

* TFIIS zinc ribbon domain signature *

Transcription factor S-II (TFIIS) [1] is  a  eukaryotic protein  necessary for
efficient  RNA polymerase II  transcription elongation, past  template-encoded
pause sites.  TFIIS shows  DNA-binding  activity only  in  the presence of RNA
polymerase II.  It  is  a  protein  of about 300 amino acids whose sequence is
highly  conserved in  mammals,  Drosophila,  yeast (where  it  was first known
as PPR2, a transcriptional regulator of URA4, and then as DST1, the DNA strand
transfer protein   alpha   [2])   and   in   the   archaebacteria   Sulfolobus
acidocaldarius [3].

This family  also  includes  the  eukaryotic and archebacterial RNA polymerase
subunits of  the  15  Kd / M family (see <PDOC00790>) as well as the following
viral proteins:

 - Vaccinia virus RNA polymerase 30 Kd subunit (rpo30) [4].
 - African swine fever virus protein I243L [5].

The best conserved region of all  these proteins  contains four cysteines that
bind a zinc ion and fold in a conformation termed a 'zinc ribbon' [6]. Besides
these cysteines,  there  are a number of other conserved residues which can be
used to help define a specific pattern for this type of domain.

Bacterial proteins   greA and  greB [1,2]  are  necessary  for  efficient  RNA
polymerase transcription elongation  past  template-encoded  arresting  sites.
Arresting sites  in  DNA  have  the property of trapping a certain fraction of
elongating RNA polymerases  that  pass  through, resulting in  locked DNA/RNA/
polymerase ternary  complexes.  Cleavage of the nascent transcript by cleavage
factors, such  as  greA or greB, allows  the resumption of elongation from the
new 3'terminus.  GreA  induces cleavage 2 or 3 nucleotides behind the terminus
while greB releases longer sequences up to 9 nucleotides in length.

GreA and greB are related proteins  of about 160 amino-acid residues.  We have
developed two   signature   patterns   for  this  protein  family.  The  first
corresponds to  a  conserved region in the N-terminal section, the second to a
region in the C-terminal section.

* DEAD and DEAH box families ATP-dependent helicases signatures *
*****************************************************************

A number of eukaryotic and  prokaryotic proteins have been characterized [1,2,
3] on  the  basis of their structural similarity. They all seem to be involved
in ATP-dependent,  nucleic-acid  unwinding. Proteins currently known to belong
to this family are:

 - Initiation factor eIF-4A. Found in eukaryotes, this protein is a subunit of
   a high  molecular  weight  complex  involved  in  5'cap recognition and the
   binding of mRNA to ribosomes. It is an ATP-dependent RNA-helicase.
 - PRP5  and PRP28. These yeast proteins are involved in various ATP-requiring
   steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process.
 - Pl10, a mouse protein expressed specifically during spermatogenesis.
 - An3, a Xenopus putative RNA helicase, closely related to Pl10.
 - SPP81/DED1 and DBP1, two  yeast  proteins  probably  involved  in  pre-mRNA
   splicing and related to Pl10.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans helicase glh-1.
 - MSS116, a yeast protein required for mitochondrial splicing.
 - SPB4, a yeast protein involved in the maturation of 25S ribosomal RNA.
 - p68, a human nuclear antigen. p68 has ATPase and DNA-helicase activities in
   vitro. It is involved in cell growth and division.
 - Rm62 (p62), a Drosophila putative RNA helicase related to p68.
 - DBP2, a yeast protein related to p68.
 - DHH1, a yeast protein.
 - DRS1, a yeast protein involved in ribosome assembly.
 - MAK5, a yeast protein involved in maintenance of dsRNA killer plasmid.
 - ROK1, a yeast protein.
 - ste13, a fission yeast protein.
 - Vasa, a Drosophila protein important for oocyte formation and specification
   of of embryonic posterior structures.
 - Me31B, a Drosophila maternally expressed protein of unknown function.
 - dbpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - deaD, an Escherichia coli  putative  RNA  helicase  which  can  suppress  a
   mutation in the rpsB gene for ribosomal protein S2.
 - rhlB, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - rhlE, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.
 - srmB, an Escherichia coli protein that shows RNA-dependent ATPase activity.
   It probably interacts with 23S ribosomal RNA.

 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins T26G10.1, ZK512.2 and ZK686.2.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR065c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR169w.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC31A2.07c.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yxiN.

All these proteins  share a number of conserved sequence motifs.  Some of them
are specific  to  this  family  while  others  are shared by other ATP-binding
proteins or  by  proteins belonging to the helicases `superfamily' [4,E1]. One
of these motifs, called the 'D-E-A-D-box', represents a special version of the
B motif of ATP-binding proteins.

Some other proteins belong to a subfamily which have His instead of the second
Asp and  are  thus  said  to  be  'D-E-A-H-box'  proteins [3,5,6,E1]. Proteins
currently known to belong to this subfamily are:

 - PRP2,  PRP16,  PRP22  and  PRP43.  These yeast proteins are all involved in
   various ATP-requiring steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process.
 - Fission yeast prh1, which my be involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
 - Male-less (mle),  a   Drosophila  protein  required in  males,  for  dosage
   compensation of X chromosome linked genes.
 - RAD3 from yeast. RAD3 is a DNA  helicase involved in excision repair of DNA
   damaged by   UV light,  bulky adducts  or  cross-linking  agents.   Fission
   yeast rad15 (rhp3)  and mammalian  DNA excision repair protein XPD (ERCC-2)
   are the homologs of RAD3.
 - Yeast CHL1 (or CTF1), which  is important  for  chromosome transmission and
   normal cell cycle progression in G(2)/M.
 - Yeast TPS1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKL078w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C06E1.10 and K03H1.2.
 - Poxviruses' early transcription  factor 70 Kd subunit  which  acts with RNA
   polymerase to initiate transcription from early gene promoters.
 - I8, a putative vaccinia virus helicase.
 - hrpA, an Escherichia coli putative RNA helicase.

We have developed signature patterns for both subfamilies.

* Eukaryotic RNA recognition motif signature and profile *
**********************************************************

Many eukaryotic proteins  that are known or  supposed  to bind single-stranded
RNA contain one or more  copies of a putative  RNA-binding  domain of about 90
amino acids [1,2]. This domain is known as the RNA recognition motif (RRM).

This region has been found in the following proteins:

   ** Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins **
 - hnRNP A1 (helix destabilizing protein) (twice).
 - hnRNP A2/B1 (twice).
 - hnRNP C (C1/C2) (once).
 - hnRNP E (UP2) (at least once).
 - hnRNP G (once).

   ** Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins **
 - U1 snRNP 70 Kd (once).
 - U1 snRNP A  (once).
 - U2 snRNP B'' (once).

   ** Pre-RNA and mRNA associated proteins **
 - Protein synthesis initiation factor  4B (eIF-4B) [3], a  protein  essential
   for the binding of mRNA to ribosomes (once).
 - Nucleolin (4 times).
 - Yeast single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein (gene SSB1) (once).
 - Yeast protein NSR1 (twice). NSR1  is  involved  in  pre-rRNA processing; it
   specifically binds nuclear localization sequences.
 - Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) (4 times).

   ** Others **
 - Drosophila sex determination protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) (twice).
 - Drosophila sex determination protein Transformer-2 (Tra-2) (once).
 - Drosophila 'elav' protein (3 times), which is  probably involved in the RNA
   metabolism of neurons.
 - Human paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis antigen HuD (3 times) [4],  which is
   highly similar to  elav  and  which  may play a role in neuron-specific RNA
   processing.
 - Drosophila 'bicoid' protein (once) [5], a segment-polarity homeobox protein
   that may also bind to specific mRNAs.
 - La antigen (once), a protein which  may play a role in the transcription of
   RNA polymerase III.
 - The 60 Kd Ro protein (once), a putative RNP complex protein.
 - A maize protein induced by abscisic acid in response to water stress, which
   seems to be a RNA-binding protein.
 - Three  tobacco  proteins,  located  in  the  chloroplast  [6], which may be
   involved in splicing and/or processing of chloroplast RNAs (twice).
 - X16 [7], a mammalian protein  which  may  be involved in RNA processing  in
   relation with cellular proliferation and/or maturation.
 - Insulin-induced growth response protein Cl-4 from rat (twice).
 - Nucleolysins  TIA-1  and  TIAR  (3  times)  [8] which possesses nucleolytic
   activity against  cytotoxic  lymphocyte  target  cells.  may be involved in
   apoptosis.
 - Yeast RNA15 protein, which plays a role in mRNA stability  and/or  poly-(A)
   tail length [9].

Inside the RRM there are two regions which are highly conserved. The first one
is a  hydrophobic  segment  of six residues (which is called the RNP-2 motif),
the second  one is an octapeptide motif (which is called RNP-1 or RNP-CS). The
position of  both  motifs  in  the  domain is shown in the following schematic
representation:

  xxxxxxx######xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx########xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
         RNP-2                              RNP-1

As a  signature  pattern for this type of domain we have used the RNP-1 motif.
We also developed a profile that spans the RRM domain.

-Consensus pattern: [RK]-G-{EDRKHPCG}-[AGSCI]-[FY]-[LIVA]-x-[FYLM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: the majority
 of RNP-1 motifs, except for about 20 proteins.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 104.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: in most cases the residue in position 3 of the pattern is either Tyr or
 Phe.
-Note: this documentation  entry  is linked  to both a signature pattern and a
 profile. As  the profile is much more sensitive than the patterns, you should
 use it if you have access to the necessary software tools to do so.

******************************************************
* Double stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) profile *
******************************************************

In contrast  to other RNA-binding domains, the about 65 amino acids long dsRBD
domain [1,2,3] has  been  found  in  a  number  of  proteins that specifically
recognize double-stranded  RNAs.  The  dsRBD  domain  is  also  known  as DSRM
(Double-Stranded RNA-binding  Motif).  dsRBD  proteins  are mainly involved in
posttranscriptional gene  regulation, for example by preventing the expression
of proteins  or  by  mediating RNAs localization. This domain is also found in
RNA editing proteins. Interaction of the dsRBD with RNA is unlikely to involve
the recognition of specific sequences [1,4,5,6]. Nevertheless, multiple dsRBDs
may be  able  to  act  in  combination to recognize the secondary structure of
specific RNAs  (i.e.  Staufen)  [1].  NMR  analysis  of  the  third  dsRBD  of
Drosophila Staufen have revealed an alpha-beta-beta-beta-alpha structure [7].

Some proteins known to include this domain are listed below.

 - Mammalian  double-stranded  RNA  adenosine  deaminase (DRADA) (EC 3.5.-.-),
   deaminates multiple  adenosines  to  inosines  by  a hydrolytic deamination
   reaction only  on  double-stranded  RNA;  editates  the  messenger RNAs for
   glutamate receptor (GLUR) subunits (4 times).
 - Mammalian    RNA-specific  editase  1  (RED1), edits the messenger RNAs for
   glutamate receptor (GLUR) subunits (4 times).
 - Vertebrate  TRBP,  a  protein  that  binds in vitro to the TAR stem-loop of
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA (5 times).
 - Mammalian   dsRNA-dependent   p68   kinase  (DAI,  TIK)  (EC  2.7.1.-),  an
   interferon-induced protein that is involved in the cellular defense against
   viral infection.
 - Animal ATP-dependent RNA helicase A.
 - Human son protein.
 - Drosophila  maleless  protein.  It  associates  with  the  X  chromosome to
   regulate dosage  compensation.  It probably unwinds double-stranded DNA and
   RNA.
 - Drosophila  Staufen,  a  developmental  protein that associate specifically
   with Oskar  and  bicoid  mRNAs,  and  is required for their localization to
   opposite poles in the egg.
 - S.pombe  Pac-1  protein  which  digests  double  stranded-RNAs  into  short
   oligonucleotide. Identified as a suppressor of meiosis.
 - Bacterial RNase III (EC 3.1.26.3), an endonuclease that digest dsRNAs.
 - Viral  E3L, a Vaccina virus protein which inhibits the p68 kinase activity,
   maybe by competing for dsRNA.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: not  all  RNase  III  proteins  are picked-up by this motif, because of
 their high divergence.

************************
* DRADA repeat profile *
************************

DRADA repeats   are   exclusively  present  in  the  double  stranded-specific
adenosine deaminase (DRADA) family. This enzyme deaminates multiple adenosines
to inosines  by a hydrolytic deamination reaction only on double-stranded RNA.
In mRNA,  inosine is read as guanosine by the translation apparatus, resulting
in codon  change  within  the  synthesized  protein.  DRADA,  among others, is
responsible for the editing of glutamate receptor mRNAs. This specific editing
alters the  gene-encoded  glutamine  (Q) to an arginine (R) located within the
channel-forming domain  of  the  glutamate  receptor  subunit.  The  result of
editing at  this  site, called the 'Q/R' site, is a profound alteration of the
Ca2+ permeability of the GLuR channel. The DRADA repeats are reiteration of an
around 70 amino acids module localized in a region important for the catalytic
activity. It  is  always  found  associated  with  the dsRBD domain [1,2] (see
<PDOC50137>).

In the human protein ADAR1 (DRADA), the N-terminal DRADA repeat has been shown
to bind  DNA  in  the  Z-conformation. As the C-terminal DRADA repeat does not
bind Z-DNA  as  a separate entity, it has been proposed that they act together
as a  single  bipartite  domain whose function could be to target ADAR1 to its
preferred substrates  by  binding  Z-DNA formed close to actively transcribing
genes [3].

Protein currently known to include this motif are listed below.

 - Mammalian double stranded-specific adenosine deaminase (DRADA).
 - Vaccinia virus VEO3 protein.

* Fibrillarin signature *
*************************

Fibrillarin [1] is a  component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(SnRNP) particle thought  to  participate in  the first step of the processing
of pre-rRNA.  In  mammals, fibrillarin  is associated with the U3, U8  and U13
small nuclear RNAs [2].

Fibrillarin is  an  extremely well  conserved  protein of about 320 amino acid
residues. Structurally it consists of three different domains:

 - An N-terminal domain of  about 80 amino acids which is very rich in glycine
   and contains a number of dimethylated arginine residues (DMA).
 - A central domain of about 90 residues  which  resembles that of RNA-binding
   proteins and contains an octameric  sequence similar to the RNP-2 consensus
   found in such proteins.
 - A C-terminal alpha-helical domain.

A protein   evolutionary   related   to  fibrillarin has  been  found  [3]  in
archaebacteria. This  protein  (gene flpA) is involved in pre-rRNA processing.
It lacks the Gly/Arg-rich N-terminal domain.

As a signature pattern, we selected a region that start with and encompass the
RNP-2 like octapeptide sequence.

************************************
* MCM family signature and profile *
************************************

Proteins shown to be required for the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication
share a highly conserved domain of about 210 amino-acid residues [1,2,3].  The
latter shows some similarities [4] with that of various other families of DNA-
dependent ATPases.  Eukaryotes  seem  to possess a family of six proteins that
contain this  domain.  They  were first identified in yeast where most of them
have a  direct  role  in  the  initiation  of  chromosomal  DNA replication by
interacting directly  with autonomously replicating sequences (ARS). They were
thus called  'minichromosome  maintenance proteins' with gene symbols prefixed
by MCM. These six proteins are:

 - MCM2, also known as cdc19 (in S.pombe) [E1].
 - MCM3, also known as DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme-associated  protein P1,
   RLF beta subunit or ROA.
 - MCM4, also known as CDC54, cdc21 (in S.pombe) or dpa (in Drosophila).
 - MCM5, also known as CDC46 or nda4 (in S.pombe).
 - MCM6, also known as mis5 (in S.pombe).
 - MCM7, also known as CDC47 or Prolifera (in A.thaliana).

This family  is  also  present  in  archebacteria. In Methanococcus jannaschii
there are four members: MJ0363, MJ0961, MJ1489 and MJECL13.

The presence of a putative ATP-binding  domain implies that these proteins may
be involved in an ATP-consuming step in  the  initiation of DNA replication in
eukaryotes.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  perfectly  conserved  region  that
represents a special version of the B motif found in ATP-binding proteins.

Xeroderma  pigmentosum (XP) [1]  is a  human   autosomal   recessive  disease,
characterized by  a  high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer.  People's
skin cells  with this condition  are hypersensitive  to ultraviolet light, due
to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair. There are a minimum of
seven genetic complementation  groups  involved in this pathway: XP-A to XP-G.
XP-A is the most severe form of  the disease and is due to defects  in a 30 Kd
nuclear protein called XPA (or XPAC) [2].

The sequence of the XPA protein  is  conserved  from  higher eukaryotes [3] to
yeast (gene RAD14) [4]. XPA is a hydrophilic  protein of 247 to 296 amino-acid
residues which has a C4-type zinc finger motif in its central section.

We have   developed  two  signature  patterns  for  XPA  proteins.  The  first
corresponds to the zinc finger region, the second to a highly conserved region
located some 12 residues after the zinc finger region.

**************************

Xeroderma  pigmentosum (XP) [1]  is a  human   autosomal   recessive  disease,
characterized by  a  high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer.  People's
skin cells  with this condition  are  hypersensitive to ultraviolet light, due
to defects in the incision step of DNA excision repair. There are a minimum of
seven genetic complementation  groups  involved in this pathway: XP-A to XP-G.
The defect in XP-G can be corrected by a 133 Kd nuclear protein called XPG (or
XPGC) [2].

XPG belongs  to a family  of  proteins  [2,3,4,5,6]  that  are composed of two
main subsets:

 - Subset  1,  to  which  belongs  XPG, RAD2 from budding yeast and rad13 from
   fission yeast.  RAD2  and  XPG are single-stranded DNA endonucleases [7,8].
   XPG makes the 3'incision in human DNA nucleotide excision repair [9].
 - Subset 2, to which belongs mouse and human FEN-1,  rad2 from fission yeast,
   and RAD27 from budding yeast. FEN-1 is a structure-specific endonuclease.

In addition  to  the  proteins  listed  in  the above groups, this family also
includes:

 - Fission yeast exo1, a 5'->3' double-stranded DNA exonuclease that could act
   in a pathway that corrects mismatched base pairs.
 - Yeast EXO1 (DHS1), a protein with probably the same function as exo1.
 - Yeast DIN7.

Sequence alignment  of  this  family of proteins reveals that similarities are
largely confined  to  two  regions.  The  first  is  located at the N-terminal
extremity  (N-region) and corresponds to the first 95 to 105 amino acids.  The
second region  is  internal  (I-region)  and  found towards the C-terminus; it
spans about  140  residues  and  contains a highly  conserved core of 27 amino
acids that includes a conserved pentapeptide (E-A-[DE]-A-[QS]). It is possible
that the  conserved acidic residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism of
DNA excision repair in XPG.  The  amino acids linking the N- and I-regions are
not conserved;  indeed, they are largely absent from proteins belonging to the
second subset.

We have  developed  two  signature  patterns  for  these proteins.  The  first
corresponds to  the central part of the N-region, the second to part of the I-
region and includes the putative catalytic core pentapeptide.

 - envY, the porin thermoregulatory  protein, which is involved in the control
   of  the  temperature-dependent  expression  of  several   Escherichia  coli
   envelope proteins such as ompF, ompC, and lamB.
 - exsA, an activator of exoenzyme S synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

   solanacearum.
 - invF, the Salmonella typhimurium invasion operon regulator.
 - marA,  which  may  be  a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the
   multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) phenotype.
 - melR, the  melibiose  operon  regulatory   protein,   which  activates  the
   transcription of the melAB genes.

   transcriptional activator.
 - rhaS, an Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium positive activator of
   genes required for rhamnose utilization.
 - rns, a protein which is required for  the  expression  of  the  cs1 and cs2
   adhesins of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.
 - rob,  a protein which binds to the right arm of the replication origin oriC
   of the Escherichia coli chromosome.
 - soxS, a protein that, with the soxR protein, controls a superoxide response
   regulon in Escherichia coli.
 - tetD, a protein from transposon TN10.
 - tcpN or toxT, the Vibrio cholerae  transcriptional  activator  of  the  tcp
   operon involved in pilus biosynthesis and transport.
 - thcR,  a  probable  regulator  of the thc operon for the degradation of the
   thiocarbamate herbicide EPTC in Rhodococcus sp. strain NI86/21.
 - ureR, the transcriptional activator of the plasmid-encoded urease operon in
   Enterobacteriaceae.
 - virF and lcrF, the Yersinia virulence regulon transcriptional activator.
 - virF, the  Shigella  transcriptional  factor  of  invasion related antigens
   ipaBCD.
 - xylR, the Escherichia coli xylose operon regulator.
 - xylS,  the  transcriptional activator of the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid
   (pWWO, pWW53 and pDK1) meta operon (xylDLEGF genes).
 - yfeG, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.

 - yhiX, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yidL, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yijO, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yuxC, a Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein.
 - yzbC, a Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein.

Except for celD, all of these  proteins seem  to  be  positive transcriptional
factors. Their size range from 107 (soxS) to 529 (yzbC) residues.

The helix-turn-helix  motif  is  located  in  the third quarter of most of the
sequences; the  N-terminal and  central regions of these proteins are presumed
to interact  with  effector molecules and may be involved in dimerization [3].
The minimal DNA binding domain, which spans roughly 100 residues and comprises
the HTH motif contains another region with similarity to classical HTH domain.
However, it  contains  an  insertion  of  one residue in the turn-region.

A signature  pattern  was  derived  from the region that follows the first HTH
domain and  that  includes  the totality of the putative second HTH domain.  A
more sensitive  detection  of  members of the araC family is available through
the use  of  a  profile  which  spans  the  minimal  DNA-binding region of 100
residues.

* Bacterial regulatory proteins, arsR family signature *
********************************************************

The many bacterial transcription regulation proteins which bind DNA  through a
'helix-turn-helix' motif can  be  classified into subfamilies  on the basis of
sequence  similarities.  One  of these subfamilies, which we call arsR, groups
together proteins that seem to dissociate from DNA  in presence of metal ions.
These proteins are listed below.

 - arsR from  various plasmids (such as R773, pSX267, pI258).  ArsR acts  as a
   transcriptional repressor of an arsenic resistance operon (ars).
 - smtB from Synechococcus  PCC 7942.  SmtB  is a transcriptional repressor of
   the smtA gene that codes for a metallothionein.
 - cadC from  plasmid pI258 and  from Bacillus firmus OF4.   CadC is a protein
   required for full cadmium-resistance.
 - Hypothetical protein yqcJ from Bacillus subtilis.

It has been shown [1] that there could  be a  helix-turn-helix  (H-T-H) region
in the central part of these proteins. An interesting feature of this putative
H-T-H region is that it contains, at  its N-terminal extremity,  one perfectly
conserved cysteine residue and another one which is found in arsR and cadC but
not  in smtA and  at  its C-terminal extremity at  least one and generally two
histidine residues. We believe [2] that  these  residues could be  involved in
metal-binding (zinc in smtB, metal-oxyanions  such as arsenite, antimonite and
arsenate for arsR, and cadmium for cadC).  Binding of a metal ion could induce
a  conformational change that  would prohibit the protein from binding to DNA.
Such a mechanism  is  highly suitable  for  regulatory  systems  that  act  to
regulate the  transcription  of  proteins involved in metal-ions efflux and/or
detoxification.

The signature pattern  for  these  proteins  span  the entire helix-turn-helix
region.

   of carbapenem antibiotics.
 - comA, Bacillus subtilis; plays a role in the expression of  late-expressing
   competence genes.

   monoamine regulon.
 - narL and narP, Escherichia coli; activate the nitrate reductase operon.

   genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The size of these proteins range from 74 (gerE) to 901 amino acids (malT), but
the majority  of  them have 190 to 230 residues. On the basis of the mechanism
by which they are activated they can be classified into two classes:

 - A  class of regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction
   system where the protein  is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on
   an aspartate  residue,  by a transmembrane kinase. The proteins that belong
   to this  class  are:  bvgA, comA, dctR; degU, evgA, fimZ, fixJ, gacA, glpR,
   narL, narP, nodW, rcsB and uhpA.
 - A    class    of  regulators  which  is activated when bound to autoinducer
   molecules such as N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine  lactone  (OHHL)  [4]. The
   proteins that belong to this class are: carR, echR, esaR, expR, lasR, luxR,
   phzR, rhlR, traR and yenR.

The 'helix-turn-helix' DNA-binding  motif  of these proteins is located in the
C-terminal section  of the sequence.   The pattern  we  use  to  detect  these
proteins starts  three residues downstream of the N-terminal  extremity of the
helix-turn-helix motif  and  extends five  residues upstream of its C-terminal
extremity.

Most of  these    proteins are transcription activators and usually negatively
regulate their own expression. They all possess a potential 'helix-turn-helix'
DNA-binding motif in their N-terminal section. The amino acid sequence pattern
we use  to  detect  these  proteins  is  a consensus sequence derived from the
complete helix-turn-helix motif and the next ten residues.

* Bacterial regulatory proteins, marR family signature *
********************************************************

The MarR  family  is  a  group  of bacterial regulatory factors, many of which
respond to  phenolic  compounds  [1,2]. To date, a clear DNA binding motif for
this family is not known, although it has been suggested that two regions with
features related  to  a  'helix-turn-helix'  motif  could  be required for DNA
binding [3].

Some proteins belonging to the marR family are listed below:

 - badR,   an   activator   of   the  anaerobic  degradation  of  benzoate  by
   Rhodopseudomonas palustris [4].
 - emrR (mprA), the repressor of the multidrug resistance pump emrAB operon in
   Escherichia coli.
 - hpcR,  the  repressor  for  the  homoprotocatechuate  catabolic pathway hpc
   operon of Escherichia coli strain C.
 - hor,  a  transcriptional  regulator  homologous  to slyA that affects genes
   involved in carbapenem and exoenzyme production in Erwinia carotovora [4].
 - hpR,  a  repressor  of  protease  production  and  sporulation  in Bacillus
   subtilis.
 - marR,   a  repressor  of  genes  which  activate  the  multiple  antibiotic
   resistance and oxidative stress regulons in Escherichia coli.
 - pecS, a regulator of pectinase, cellulase, and  blue  pigment production in
   Erwinia chrysanthemi.
 - petP, a protein from  Rhodobacter capsulatus  necessary  for photosynthetic
   and respiratory growth.
 - papX, an unidentified  reading frame downstream of the pap pilin  operon of
   uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
 - prsX, an unidentified  reading frame downstream of the prs pilin  operon of
   uropathogenic Escherichia coli.
 - rap,  a  regulatory  protein  homologous  to slyA that affects synthesis of
   carbapenem and prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens [4].
 - slyA, from Escherichia coli  and Salmonella typhimuriumm, a transcriptional
   activator of a cryptic hemolysin.
 - ywaE (or ipa-10R), a hypothetical protein from Bacillus subtilis.
 - yxaD (or S14D), a hypothetical protein from Bacillus subtilis.
 - yybA, a hypothetical protein from Bacillus subtilis.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  have  picked  a 34 residue segment showing high
conservation within  this  family. This conserved region may be located in the
DNA binding domain.

* Bacterial regulatory proteins, merR family signature *
********************************************************

The many bacterial transcription regulation proteins which bind DNA  through a
'helix-turn-helix' motif can  be  classified into subfamilies  on the basis of
sequence similarities. One of these subfamilies groups together:

 - Mercuric resistance operon regulatory protein merR [1,2].  MerR,  which  is
   found in many bacterial species mediates  the  mercuric-dependent induction
   of the mercury resistance operon.  In the absence of mercury merR represses
   transcription by binding tightly, as a dimer, to the 'mer' operator region;
   when mercury is present the dimeric complex  binds a single ion and becomes
   a potent transcriptional activator, while remaining bound to the mer site.
 - bltR  and bmrR, the transcriptional activators of the blr and bmr multidrug
   transporters in Bacillus subtilis [3].
 - glnR, the transcriptional repressor of the glnRA operon in Bacillus [4].
 - hspR,  a  Streptomyces coelicolor protein that binds to the promoter of the
   dnaK operon.
 - nolA,  a  nodulation  protein  from  Bradyrhizobium  japonicum [5]. Nola is
   involved in the genotype-specific nodulation of soybeans.
 - soxR, a protein that, with the soxS protein, controls a superoxide response
   regulon in Escherichia coli.
 - tipA  from  Streptomyces  lividans [6]; tipA is a transcriptional activator
   which binds to and is activated by the antibiotic thiostrepton.
 - yehV, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein.
 - yhdM, an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein [7].
 - yyaN, a Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein.
 - HI0186, a Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein.
 - HI0293, a Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein.

The 'helix-turn-helix' DNA-binding motif of these proteins  is  located in the
N-terminal part of the sequences.  The pattern we use to detect these proteins
starts at position 2 of the helix-turn-helix motif  and  extend three residues
upstream of its C-terminal extremity.

   glycine betaine pathway.
 - bm3R1, from Bacillus megaterium,  a repressor of the expression of the gene
   for cytochrome P450Bm-3.
 - envR,  from  Escherichia coli, a potential repressor  of the  acrEF (envCD)
   operon.
 - mtrR,  from  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,  a possible regulator of cell envelope
   permeability; acts as a repressor of mtrC.
 - tcmR,  from  Streptomyces  glaucescens,  a  regulator  of resistance to the

 - Rv2912c, a Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein.
 - A Staphylococcus aureus hypothetical protein in qacA 5'region.

Many of  these  proteins  appear to be repressors, and their targets are genes
encoding proteins  involved  in  cell  envelope  permeability.  They  all have
similar molecular  weights  -  from 21 to 25 Kd. The helix-turn-helix motif is

* Transcriptional antiterminators bglG family signature *
*********************************************************

Escherichia coli bglG  protein  mediates  the positive regulation of the beta-
glucoside (bgl) operon  by  functioning  as a  transcriptional antiterminator.
bglG is a RNA-binding protein that recognizes a specific sequence located just
upstream of two termination sites within the operon.   The activity of bglG is
supressed by its phosphorylation [2] by bglF (EII-bgl), the  permease from the
beta-glucoside PTS system.

BglG is highly similar to the following proteins, which  also  probably act as
transcriptional antiterminators:

 - arbG  from  Erwinia chrysanthemi [3], also  involved in the regulation of a
   beta-glucoside operon. ArbG is probably phosphorylated by arbF (EII-bgl).
 - lacT  from   Lactobacillus casei [4], involved in the regulation of the lac
   operon.
 - sacT from Bacillus subtilis,  which regulates the expression of the sucrose
   operon (sacPA). SacT is probably phosphorylated by sacP (EII-scr).
 - sacY from  Bacillus  subtilis,   which  regulates  the  expression  of  the
   levansucrase operon (sacBX).  SacY is  probably  phosphorylated by the sacX
   protein.
 - licT from Bacillus subtilis [5], which regulates the expression of the gene
   for endoglucanase.
 - levR from Bacillus subtilis, which regulates the expression of the levanase
   operon (levDEFG and sacC). LevR is  composed  of  two domains: a N-terminal
   section that contains a  sigma-54 factor interaction ATP-binding domain and
   a C-terminal  bglG-like  domain.  LevR  could  be phosphorylated by levD or
   levE.

As a signature pattern for these proteins, we selected a conserved region that
includes a conserved histidine that could be the site of phosphorylation.

**************************************************
* Sigma-54 factors family signatures and profile *
**************************************************

Sigma factors [1] are bacterial transcription initiation factors  that promote
the attachment of the core RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are
then released.  They  alter  the  specificity  of  promoter  recognition. Most
bacteria express a multiplicity of sigma factors. Two of these factors, sigma-
70 (gene  rpoD),  generally  known  as the major or primary sigma factor,  and
sigma-54 (gene  rpoN  or  ntrA)  direct the transcription of a wide variety of
genes. The    other  sigma  factors,  known  as alternative sigma factors, are
required for the transcription of specific subsets of genes.

With regard  to  sequence  similarity,  sigma  factors can be grouped into two
classes: the  sigma-54  and  sigma-70  families.  The sigma-70 family has many
different sigma  factors  (see the relevant entry <PDOC00592>).   The sigma-54
family consists   exclusively  of  sigma-54  factor  [2,3]  required  for  the
transcription of  promoters  that  have a characteristic -24 and -12 consensus
recognition element  but  which  are  devoid  of the typical -10,-35 sequences
recognized by   the  major    sigma  factors.  The  sigma-54  factor  is  also
characterized by  its  interaction  with    ATP-dependent  positive regulatory
proteins that bind to upstream activating sequences.

Structurally sigma-54 factors consist of three distinct regions:

 - A relatively well  conserved N-terminal glutamine-rich region  of about  50
   residues that contains a potential leucine zipper motif.
 - A region of variable length which is not well conserved.
 - A well conserved C-terminal region  of about  350  residues that contains a
   second potential leucine zipper, a potential DNA-binding 'helix-turn-helix'
   motif and a perfectly conserved octapeptide whose function is not known.

We  developed  two signature patterns  for  this family  of sigma factors. The
first starts  two  residues before the N-terminal extremity of the helix-turn-
helix region and ends two residues before its C-terminal extremity. The second
is the conserved octapeptide. A profile has also been designed that covers the
whole C-terminal region.

which are listed below:

 - Bacillus  sigma  factors  involved  in  the control of sporulation-specific
   genes: sigma-E  (sigE or spoIIGB), sigma-F (sigF or spoIIAC), sigma-G (sigG
   or spoIIIG),      sigma-H      (sigH   or   spo0C)  and  sigma-K  (sigK  or

 - Escherichia coli and related bacteria sigma-32 (gene rpoH or htpR) involved
   in the expression of heat shock genes.
 - Escherichia coli  and  related   bacteria  sigma-27 (gene fliA) involved in

 - Escherichia  coli   sigma-S (gene rpoS or katF)  which seems to be involved
   in the  expression  of  genes  required  for  protection  against  external
   stresses.
 - Myxococcus xanthus sigma-B  (sigB)  which  is  essential for the late-stage
   differentiation of that bacteria.

Alignments of the sigma-70 family permit the identification of four regions of
high conservation [2,3].  Each of these four regions can in turn be subdivided
into a number of sub-regions. We developed signature patterns based on the two
best conserved sub-regions.  The  first pattern corresponds to sub-region 2.2;
the exact  function of  this sub-region is  not  known  although  it could  be
involved in the binding of  the sigma factor to  the core RNA polymerase.  The
second pattern corresponds  to  sub-region  4.2  which seems to harbor  a DNA-
binding 'helix-turn-helix'    motif    involved  in  binding the conserved -35
region of  promoters recognized by the major sigma factors. The second pattern
starts one  residue  before  the  N-terminal  extremity  of the HTH region and
ends six residues after its C-terminal extremity.

********************************************
* Sigma-70 factors ECF subfamily signature *
********************************************

Sigma factors [1] are bacterial transcription initiation factors  that promote
the attachment of the core RNA polymerase to specific initiation sites and are
then released.  They  alter  the  specificity  of  promoter  recognition. Most
bacteria express  a multiplicity of sigma factors.  With regards  to  sequence
similarity, sigma  factors  can be grouped into two classes: the  sigma-54 and
sigma-70 families.  The  sigma-70  family includes, in addition to the primary
sigma factor, a wide variety  of sigma factors.  It also  includes a divergent
subfamily [2] that regulates  gene encoding for proteins with extracytoplasmic
function. The proteins that are currently known to belong to this sigma factor
subfamily, known as ECF, are:

 - algU, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which regulates genes  for extracellular
   alginate biosynthesis.
 - carQ, from Myxococcus xanthus, which  is involved  in the regulation of the
   light induced biosynthesis of membrane-localized carotenoids.
 - cnrH, from  Alcaligenes eutrophus plasmid pMOL28, which regulates the genes
   for a membrane-located efflux  system that confers resistance to nickel and
   cobalt.
 - fecI, from Escherichia coli,  which regulates the fec genes for periplasmic
   iron dicitrate transport.
 - hrpL,  from  Pseudomonas  syringae,  which is involved in the activation of
   hrp loci genes which are involved in plant pathogenicity.
 - rpoE,   from  Escherichia  coli,  Salmonella  typhimurium  and  Haemophilus
   influenzae. RpoE  is  involved in heat shock and oxidative stress response;
   it is  believed  to  control  protein  processing  in  the extracytoplasmic
   compartment.
 - rfaY, from Xanthomonas campestris,  which is involved in lipopolysaccharide
   biosynthesis and pathogenicity.
 - sigE, from Streptococcus coelicolor, which is involved in the transcription
   of the dagA gene coding for an extracellular agar-degrading enzyme.
 - sigV, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigX, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigY, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - sigZ, a Bacillus subtilis sigma factor.
 - HI1459, a hypothetical Haemophilus influenzae sigma factor.

As a  signature  pattern  for  the  ECF  subfamily  we  chose  the region that
corresponds to  subdomain  2.2  in classical sigma-70 factors [3]; this region
seems to  be  involved  in  the  binding  of  the sigma factor to the core RNA
polymerase.

* Sigma-54 interaction domain signatures and profile *
******************************************************

Some bacterial  regulatory  proteins  activate  the  expression  of genes from
promoters recognized by core RNA polymerase  associated  with  the alternative
sigma-54 factor. These have a conserved domain of about 230 residues  involved
in the  ATP-dependent  [1,2]  interaction  with sigma-54. This domain has been
found in the proteins listed below:

 - acoR from Alcaligenes eutrophus, an  activator  of  the  acetoin catabolism
   operon acoXABC.
 - algB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  an  activator  of  alginate biosynthetic
   gene algD.
 - dctD from Rhizobium, an  activator of dctA,  the C4-dicarboxylate transport
   protein.
 - dhaR  from Citrobacter freundii, a regulator of the dha operon for glycerol
   utilization.
 - fhlA from Escherichia coli, an activator of the formate dehydrogenase H and
   hydrogenase III structural genes.
 - flbD from Caulobacter crescentus, an activator of flagellar genes.
 - hoxA from Alcaligenes eutrophus, an activator of the hydrogenase operon.
 - hrpS from Pseudomonas syringae, an  activator of  hprD as well as other hrp
   loci involved in plant pathogenicity.
 - hupR1 from  Rhodobacter capsulatus, an  activator of the [NiFe] hydrogenase
   genes hupSL.
 - hydG from Escherichia coli  and Salmonella typhimurium, an activator of the
   hydrogenase activity.
 - levR from Bacillus subtilis, which regulates the expression of the levanase
   operon (levDEFG and sacC).
 - nifA (as well as anfA and vnfA)  from various bacteria, an activator of the
   nif nitrogen-fixing operon.
 - ntrC, from various bacteria, an  activator  of  nitrogen assimilatory genes
   such as that for glutamine synthetase (glnA) or of the nif operon.
 - pgtA from Salmonella typhimurium,  the  activator of the inducible phospho-
   glycerate transport system.
 - pilR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an activator of pilin gene transcription.
 - rocR   from   Bacillus   subtilis,  an  activator  of  genes  for  arginine
   utilization
 - tyrR from Escherichia coli, involved  in  the transcriptional regulation of
   aromatic amino-acid biosynthesis and transport.
 - wtsA,  from  Erwinia  stewartii,  an  activator of plant pathogenicity gene
   wtsB.
 - xylR  from Pseudomonas putida, the  activator  of  the  tol  plasmid xylene
   catabolism operon xylCAB and of xylS.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfhA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhgB.

About half of these proteins (algB, dcdT, flbD, hoxA, hupR1, hydG,  ntrC, pgtA
and pilR) belong to signal transduction  two-component systems [3] and possess
a domain  that  can  be  phosphorylated by a sensor-kinase protein in their N-
terminal section.    Almost  all  of these proteins possess a helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding domain in their C-terminal section.

The domain which  interacts with  the sigma-54 factor  has an ATPase activity.
This  may be required  to  promote a  conformational  change necessary for the
interaction [4]. The domain contains  an atypical ATP-binding motif A (P-loop)
as well as a form of motif B. The two ATP-binding motifs are located in the N-
terminal  section of the domain; we have developed signature patterns for both
motifs. Other  regions  of the domain are also conserved. We have selected one
of them, located in the C-terminal section, as a third signature pattern.

* Single-strand binding protein family signatures *
***************************************************

The Escherichia coli single-strand  binding protein [1] (gene ssb), also known
as the    helix-destabilizing protein, is  a  protein  of  177 amino acids. It
binds tightly, as a homotetramer, to single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and plays an
important role in DNA replication, recombination and repair.

Closely related  variants of SSB  are  encoded  in  the genome of a variety of
large self-transmissible plasmids. SSB has also been characterized in bacteria
such as Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

Eukaryotic mitochondrial  proteins  that bind ss-DNA and are probably involved
in mitochondrial  DNA replication are structurally and evolutionary related to
prokaryotic SSB.  Proteins  currently  known  to  belong to this subfamily are
listed below [2].

   - Mammalian protein Mt-SSB (P16).
   - Xenopus Mt-SSBs and Mt-SSBr.
   - Drosophila MtSSB.
   - Yeast protein RIM1.

We have  developed  two  signature patterns for these proteins. The first is a
conserved region  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the SSB's.  The second is a
centrally located  region  which,  in  Escherichia  coli  SSB,  is known to be
involved in the binding of DNA.

* Bacterial histone-like DNA-binding proteins signature *
*********************************************************

Bacteria  synthesize  a set  of  small,  usually  basic proteins  of  about 90
residues that bind DNA and are known as histone-like proteins [1,2]. The exact
function of  these proteins is not yet clear but they  are capable of wrapping
DNA and   stabilizing   it   from  denaturation  under  extreme  environmental
conditions.  The sequence of a number of different types  of these proteins is
known:

 - The HU proteins, which, in Escherichia coli, are a dimer of closely related
   alpha and  beta  chains  and,  in other bacteria, can be dimer of identical
   chains. HU-type  proteins  have  been  found  in  a  variety of eubacteria,
   cyanobacteria and archaebacteria, and are also encoded  in  the chloroplast
   genome of some algae [3].
 - The integration host factor (IHF), a dimer of  closely related chains which
   seem to  function  in genetic recombination as well as in translational and
   transcriptional control [4] in enterobacteria.
 - The bacteriophage sp01 transcription factor 1 (TF1) which selectively binds
   to and inhibits  the  transcription  of hydroxymethyluracil-containing DNA,
   such as sp01 DNA, by RNA polymerase in vitro.
 - The African Swine fever virus protein A104R (or LMW5-AR) [5].

As a signature pattern for  this family of proteins,  we use a  twenty residue
sequence which includes three perfectly conserved positions.  According to the
tertiary structure  of  one  of these proteins [6], this pattern spans exactly
the first half of the flexible DNA-binding arm.

* Dps protein family signatures *

Escherichia coli protein dps [1] is a DNA-binding protein, synthesized  during
prolonged starvation,  that  seems  to  protect DNA from oxidative damage. Dps
binds DNA without any apparent sequence specificity. It  is a protein of about
19 Kd  that  associates  into a complex  of 12 subunits  forming  two  stacked
hexameric rings.

Proteins similar to dps have been found in other bacteria:

 - Bacillus subtilis protein mrgA.
 - Antigen TpF1/TyF1 from Treponema pallidum and pertenue.
 - Haemophilus ducreyi fine tangled pili major subunit (gene ftpA).
 - Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein A (gene napA).

 - A hypothetical protein  encoded  in  the 5' region of a  gene coding  for a

All these proteins  share  a conserved  region of  about 50 residues in  their

The bacterial   recA   protein   [1,2,3,E1]   is   essential   for  homologous
recombination and   recombinational  repair  of  DNA  damage.  RecA  has  many
activities: it  filaments,  it  binds  to  single- and double-stranded DNA, it
binds and hydrolyzes ATP,  it is also a recombinase and, finally, it interacts
with lexA causing its activation and leading to its autocatalytic cleavage.

RecA is  a protein of about 350 amino-acid residues. Its sequence is very well
conserved [3,4,5,E1]    among  eubacterial  species.  It  is also found in the
chloroplast of plants [6].

The recA protein is closely related to:

 - Eukaryotic  RAD51  protein. Promotes homologous pairing and strand exchange
   on chromatin.
 - Eukaryotic DMC1 protein. Participates in meiotic recombination.
 - Prokaryotic  radA  protein.  Involved  in  DNA  repair  and  in  homologous
   recombination.
 - Bacteriophage  uvsX  gene product. Important  in genetic recombination, DNA 
   repair, and replication.

As a  signature  pattern  specific  for  the  bacterial and chloroplastic recA
protein, we  selected  the best conserved region, a nonapeptide located in the
middle of the sequence and which is part of the monomer-monomer interface in a

High mobility group (HMG) proteins  are a  family of  relatively low molecular
weight non-histone components in chromatin.  HMG-I  and HMG-Y  are proteins of
about 100 amino acid  residues which  are produced by the alternative splicing
of a  single gene  (HMG-Y  differs  from  HMG-I by the internal deletion of 11
amino acids).  HMG-I/Y bind  preferentially  to  the  minor groove of A+T-rich
regions in double-stranded DNA.   It  is suggested  that these  proteins could
function  in  nucleosome   phasing  and  in   the 3' end  processing  of  mRNA
transcripts.  They are also involved in  the transcription regulation of genes
containing, or in close proximity to, A+T-rich regions.

DNA-binding of these  proteins is effected by a 11 residues domain, called the
A+T-hook [1], this domain is repeated three times in the sequence of HMG-I/Y.

*************************************
* Bromodomain signature and profile *
*************************************

The bromodomain [1,2,3] is a conserved region of about 70 amino acids found in
the following proteins:

 - Higher  eukaryotes  transcription  initiation  factor  TFIID 250 Kd subunit
   (TBP-associated factor  p250)  (gene  CCG1). P250 associated with the TFIID
   TATA-box binding  protein  and  seems  essential for progression  of the G1
   phase of the cell cycle.
 - Human  RING3,  a  protein  of  unknown function encoded in the MHC class II
   locus.
 - Mammalian  CREB-binding  protein (CBP), which mediates cAMP-gene regulation
   by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein.
 - Drosophila female sterile homeotic protein (gene fsh),  required maternally
   for proper   expression   of  other  homeotic  genes  involved  in  pattern
   formation, such as Ubx.
 - Drosophila brahma protein (gene brm), a protein required for the activation
   of multiple homeotic genes.
 - Mammalian  homologs  of  brahma.  In human,  three brahma-like proteins are
   known: SNF2a(hBRM), SNF2b, and BRG1.
 - Human  BS69,  a  protein  that  binds  to  adenovirus  E1A and inhibits E1A
   transactivation
 - Human peregrin (or Br140).
 - Yeast  BDF1  [3],  a  transcription  factor involved in the expression of a
   broad class of genes including snRNAs.
 - Yeast  GCN5,  a general transcriptional activator operating in concert with
   certain other   DNA-binding   transcriptional  activators,  such  as  GCN4,
   HAP2/3/4 or ADA2.
 - Yeast NPS1/STH1, involved in G(2) phase control in mitosis.
 - Yeast  SNF2/SWI2,  which is part of a complex with the SNF5, SNF6, SWI3 and
   ADR6/SWI1 proteins.   This   SWI-complex  is  involved  in  transcriptional
   activation.
 - Yeast SPT7, a transcriptional activator of  Ty elements and possibly  other
   genes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein cbp-1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGR056w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKR008w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein L9638.1.

Some proteins  contain  a  region  which,  while  similar  to some extent to a
classical bromodomain,  diverges  from it by either lacking part of the domain
or because of an insertion. These proteins are:

 - Mammalian  protein  HRX (also known as All-1 or MLL), a protein involved in
   translocations leading  to  acute  leukemias  and  which possibly acts as a
   transcriptional regulatory  factor. HRX contains a region similar to the C-
   terminal half of the bromodomain.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  hypothetical  protein  ZK783.4. The bromodomain of
   this protein has a 23 amino-acid insertion.
 - Yeast  protein  YTA7.  This  protein  contains  a  region  with significant
   similarity to  the C-terminal half of the bromodomain. As it is a member of
   the AAA  family  (see  <PDOC00572>)  it is also in a functionally different
   context.

The above proteins generally contain a single  bromodomain,  but  some of them
contain two  copies,  this  is the case of BDF1, CCG1, fsh, RING3, YKR008w and
L9638.1.

The exact function  of this domain is not yet known  but  it  is thought to be
involved in  protein-protein  interactions  and   it may be important  for the
assembly or  activity  of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional
activation.

The consensus  pattern  that  we  have  developed  spans  a  major part of the
bromodomain; a  more  sensitive    detection is available through the use of a
profile which spans the whole domain.

* Chromo domain signature and profile *
***************************************

The 'chromo' (CHRromatin Organization MOdifier) domain [1 to 4] is a conserved
region of  about  60  amino  acids  which  was  originally found in Drosophila
modifiers of  variegation,  which  are  proteins  that modify the structure of
chromatin to  the  condensed  morphology  of  heterochromatin, a cytologically
visible condition where gene expression is repressed. In protein Polycomb, the
chromo domain has been shown to be important for chromatin targeting. Proteins
that contains a chromo domain seem to fall into three classes:

 a) Proteins  which have a N-terminal chromo domain followed by a region which
    is related  to  but  distinct  from  the  chromo domain and which has been
    termed [3] the 'chromo shadow' domain.
 b) Proteins with a single chromo domain.
 c) Proteins with paired tandem chromo domains.

Currently, this domain has been found in the following proteins:

 Class A.
 - Drosophila heterochromatin protein Su(var)205 (HP1).
 - Human heterochromatin protein HP1 alpha.
 - Mammalian modifier 1 and modifier 2.
 - Fission  yeast  swi6,  a  protein  involved in the repression of the silent
   mating-type loci mat2 and mat3.

 Class B.
 - Drosophila protein Polycomb (Pc).
 - Mammalian modifier 3, a homolog of Pc.
 - Drosophila protein Su(var)3-9, a suppressor of position-effect variegation.
 - Human Mi-2 autoantigen, characterisitic of dermatomyosis.
 - Fungal  retrotranposon  polyproteins:  'skippy'  from  Fusarium  oxysporum,
   'grasshopper' and  'MAGGY'   from   Magnaporthe   grisea   and  CfT-1  from
   Cladosporium fulvum.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC18G6.02c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C29H12.5
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK1236.2.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09A5.8.


 Class C.
 - Mammalian DNA-binding/helicase proteins CHD-1 to CHD-4.
 - Yeast protein CHD1.

The signature  pattern  for  this  domain  corresponds  to  its best conserved

* Regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) signatures and profile *
**********************************************************************

The regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) [1]  is  a  eukaryotic protein
which binds  to  chromatin  and  interacts  with  ran,  a  nuclear GTP-binding
protein (see <PDOC00859>),  to promote the loss of bound GDP and the uptake of
fresh GTP,  thus  acting as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator (GDS)
[2]. The  interaction of RCC1 with ran probably plays an important role in the
regulation of gene expression.

RCC1, known  as    PRP20  or  SRM1  in yeast, pim1 in fission yeast and BJ1 in
Drosophila, is  a  protein  that  contains seven tandem repeats of a domain of
about 50   to   60   amino   acids.   As  shown  in  the  following  schematic
representation, the  repeats  make  up  the  major  part  of the length of the
protein. Outside the repeat region, there is just a small N-terminal domain of
about 40  to  50  residues  and,  in the Drosophila protein only, a C-terminal
domain of about 130 residues.

+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------+
|N-t.|Rpt. 1 |Rpt. 2 |Rpt. 3 |Rpt. 4 |Rpt. 5 |Rpt. 6 |Rpt. 7 | C-terminal  |

RCC1 repeats are also found in the following proteins:

- Mammalian retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) [3]. Mutations in the
  RPGR gene  cause  X-linked  retinitis  pigmentosa  type  3  (RP3), a severe,
  progressive and   degenerative   retinal  dystrophy  eventually  leading  to
  complete blindness.
- Mammalian  HERC2 protein. A putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor that
  could be involved in protein trafficking.

We developed  two  signature patterns for RCC1.  The  first is found in the N-
terminal part  of  the second repeat; this is the most conserved part of RCC1.
The second  is derived from conserved positions in the C-terminal part of each
repeat and detects up to five copies of the repeated domain. We also developed
a profile that covers the whole repeat.

Protamines are small, highly  basic  proteins, that substitute for histones in
sperm chromatin  during  the    haploid phase  of  spermatogenesis.  They pack
sperm  DNA into  a   highly  condensed, stable and inactive complex. There are
two different  types  of  mammalian  protamine,  called P1 and P2. P1 has been
found in  all species studied, while P2 is sometimes absent. There seems to be
a single  type of avian protamine whose sequence is closely related to that of
mammalian P1 [1].

As a signature  for this family of proteins, we selected a conserved region at
the N-terminal extremity of the sequence.

In mammals, the second  stage  of  spermatogenesis  is  characterized  by  the
conversion of  nucleosomal  chromatin   to  the  compact,  nonnucleosomal  and
transcriptionally inactive form found in the sperm nucleus.  This condensation
is  associated  with  a  double-protein  transition.   The  first   transition
corresponds to the  replacement  of  histones  by  several  spermatid-specific
proteins (also called transition proteins) which  are  themselves  replaced by
protamines during the second transition.

Nuclear transition protein 1  (TP1) [1] is  one  of  these  spermatid-specific
proteins.  TP1 is a basic protein of 54 amino-acid residues  whose sequence is
well conserved in mammalian species.   As  a signature  pattern, we selected a
heptapeptide located in positions 28 to 34.   This  heptapeptide contains five
basic residues (Arg or Lys) as well as a  tyrosine that could be essential for
the destabilization of chromatin by intercalating between the bases of DNA.

Nuclear transition   protein  2  (TP2)  is  one  of  those  spermatid-specific
proteins.  TP2 is a basic,  zinc-binding protein [1] of  116 to 137 amino-acid
residues. Structurally,  TP2   consists of  three  distinct parts: a conserved
serine-rich N-terminal  domain of about 25 residues, a variable central domain
of 20  to  50  residues  which  contains cysteine residues, and a conserved C-
terminal domain of about 70 residues rich in lysines and arginines.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for TP2: one located in the N-terminal
domain, the other in the C-terminal.

Mismatch repair contributes to the overall fidelity of DNA replication [1]. It
involves the correction of mismatched base pairs that  have been missed by the
proofreading  element  of the DNA polymerase complex.     The sequence of some
proteins involved in mismatch repair in different organisms have been found to
be evolutionary related [2,3]. One of these families is called mutS [4,E1], it 
consists of:

 - Prokaroytic  protein  mutS  protein  (also  called  hexA  in  Streptococcus
   pneumoniae).  Muts is thought to carry out the mismatch recognition step of
   DNA repair.
 - Eukaryotic MSH1, which is involved in mitochondrial DNA repair.
 - Eukaryotic MSH2,  which  is  involved  in  nuclear postreplication mismatch
   repair. MSH2 heterodimerizes with MSH6.  In man, MSH2 is involved in a form
   of familial hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).
 - Eukaryotic MSH3, which is probably involved in the repair of large loops.
 - Eukaryotic MSH4, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Eukaryotic MSH5, which is involved in meiotic recombination.
 - Eukaryotic MSH6 (also known as G/T mismatch binding protein), a  DNA-repair
   protein that binds to G/T mismatches through heterodimerization with MSH2.
 - Prokaryotic protein mutS2 whose function is not yet known.
 - A coral (Sarcophyton glaucum) mitochondrial encoded mutS-like protein.

As a signature pattern for  this class of mismatch repair proteins we selected
a region rich in glycine and negatively charged residues. This region is found
in the C-terminal  section of  these  proteins;  about  80  residues to the C-
terminal of an ATP-binding site motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).

* Nudix hydrolase signature *

The bacterial  mutT  protein  is involved in the GO system [1] responsible for
removing an   oxidatively   damaged   form  of  guanine  (8-hydroxyguanine  or
7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) from  DNA  and  the  nucleotide  pool. 8-oxo-dGTP is
inserted opposite  to  dA  and  dC  residues of template DNA with almost equal
efficiency thus  leading  to  A.T  to  G.C  transversions.  MutT  specifically
degrades 8-oxo-dGTP  to  the  monophosphate  with  the  concomitant release of
pyrophosphate. MutT is a small protein of about 12 to 15 Kd.

It has  been  shown [2,3] that a region of about 40 amino acid residues, which
is found  in  the  N-terminal  part of mutT, can also be found in a variety of
other prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryotic proteins. These proteins are:

 - Streptomyces pneumoniae mutX.
 - A mutT homolog from plasmid pSAM2 of Streptomyces ambofaciens.
 - Bartonella bacilliformis invasion protein A (gene invA).
 - Escherichia coli dATP pyrophosphohydrolase.
 - Protein D250 from African swine fever viruses.
 - Proteins D9 and D10 from a variety of poxviruses.
 - Mammalian 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine triphosphatase (EC 3.1.6.-) [4].
 - Mammalian  diadenosine  5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate asymmetrical hydrolase
   (Ap4Aase) (EC  3.6.1.17)  [5], which cleaves A-5'-PPPP-5'A to yield AMP and
   ATP.
 - A  protein  encoded  on  the  antisense  RNA of the basic fibroblast growth
   factor gene in higher vertebrates.
 - Yeast protein YSA1.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfaO.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein ygdU and HI0901, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yjaD and HI0432, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yrfE.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yqkG.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yzgD.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGL067w.

It is  proposed  [2] that the conserved domain could be involved in the active
center of a family of pyrophosphate-releasing NTPases.  As a signature pattern
we selected the  core  region  of  the  domain;  it  contains  four  conserved
glutamate residues.

The bacterial  dnaA  protein [1,2,3] plays an important role in initiating and
regulating chromosomal  replication.  DnaA is an ATP- and DNA-binding protein.
It binds specifically to 9 bp nucleotide repeats known as dnaA boxes which are
found in the chromosome origin of replication (oriC).

DnaA is  a  protein  of  about  50 Kd that contains two conserved regions: the
first is  located  in  the  N-terminal half and corresponds to the ATP-binding
domain, the  second is located in the C-terminal half and could be involved in
DNA-binding. We  used  the  most  conserved  part  of the putative DNA-binding
domain as a signature pattern.

* Small, acid-soluble spore proteins, alpha/beta type, signatures *
*******************************************************************

Small, acid-soluble spore proteins  (SASP or ASSP) [1,2] are proteins found in
the spores of  bacteria  of  the  genera  Bacillus,  Thermoactynomycetes,  and
Clostridium. SASP are bound to spore DNA. They are double-stranded DNA-binding
proteins  that cause DNA to change to an A-like conformation. They protect the
DNA backbone from chemical  and  enzymatic  cleavage  and are thus involved in
dormant spore's high resistance to UV light.  SASP  are  degraded in the first
minutes of spore  germination  and  provide  amino  acids for both new protein
synthesis and metabolism.

There are two distinct families  of SASP: the  alpha/beta type and the  gamma-
type. Alpha/beta SASP are small proteins of about sixty to  seventy amino acid
residues.  They  are generally  coded by a multigene family.  Two  regions  of
alpha/beta SASP are particularly well conserved: the  first  region is located
in the N-terminal  half  and  contains  the  site  which is cleaved by a SASP-
specific protease that acts during  germination;  the second region is located
in the C-terminal section and is probably involved in DNA-binding. We selected
both regions as signature patterns for these proteins.

* Zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases signatures *
*****************************************************

Alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) catalyzes the reversible oxidation of
ethanol to acetaldehyde with the concomitant  reduction of NAD [1].  Currently
three,   structurally   and   catalytically,   different  types   of   alcohol
dehydrogenases are known:

 - Zinc-containing 'long-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Insect-type, or 'short-chain' alcohol dehydrogenases.
 - Iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases.

Zinc-containing ADH's [2,3] are  dimeric or  tetrameric enzymes  that bind two
atoms of zinc per subunit.  One  of  the  zinc atom is essential for catalytic
activity while the other is not.   Both  zinc atoms  are coordinated by either
cysteine or histidine residues;  the  catalytic zinc  is  coordinated  by  two
cysteines  and one histidine.   Zinc-containing ADH's  are  found in bacteria,
mammals, plants, and in fungi. In most species there are more than one isozyme
(for example,  human  have  at  least six isozymes, yeast have three, etc.). A
number of  other   zinc-dependent dehydrogenases  are  closely related to zinc
ADH [4], these are:

 - Xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.9) (D-xylulose reductase).
 - Sorbitol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.14).
 - Aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.90) (benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase).
 - Threonine 3-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.103).
 - Cinnamyl-alcohol  dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.195)  (CAD) [5]. CAD is a plant
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lignin.
 - Galactitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.251).
 - Pseudomonas putida 5-exo-alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) [6].
 - Escherichia coli starvation sensing protein rspB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjgB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjgV.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjjN.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL060w (FUN49).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL061w (FUN50).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YCR105w.

The pattern that  we developed to  detect this  class of enzymes is based on a
conserved region that includes a histidine  residue which is the second ligand
of the catalytic zinc atom.

This family also includes NADP-dependent quinone  oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.5),
an enzyme found in bacteria (gene qor), in yeast and in mammals where, in some
species such as rodents, it has  been  recruited as an eye lens protein and is
known as  zeta-crystallin  [7].  The  sequence  of  quinone  oxidoreductase is
distantly related to that other zinc-containing alcohol  dehydrogenases and it
lacks the zinc-ligand residues. The torpedo fish and mammlian synaptic vesicle
membrane protein vat-1 is realted to qor. We have developed a specific pattern
for this subfamily.

Iron-containing ADH's have been found in  yeast (gene ADH4) [2], as well as in
Zymomonas mobilis (gene adhB) [3]. These two iron-containing ADH's are closely
related to the following enzymes:

 - Escherichia coli propanediol oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.77)  (gene fucO) [4],
   an enzyme involved  in the metabolism of  fucose and  which  also  seems to
   contain ferrous ion(s).
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum NADPH- and NADH-dependent butanol dehydrogenases
   (EC 1.1.1.-) (genes adh1, bdhA and bdhB) [5], an enzyme which has  activity
   using butanol and ethanol as substrates.
 - Escherichia coli adhE [6], an   iron-dependent enzyme  which  harbor  three
   different activities:  alcohol  dehydrogenase,  acetaldehyde  dehydrogenase
   (acetylating) (EC 1.2.1.10) and pyruvate-formate-lyase deactivase.
 - Bacterial glycerol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.6) (gene gldA or dhaD) [7].

   (EC 1.1.1.61).

 - 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid   dehydrogenase   (EC  1.1.1.50),  which  terminates
   androgen  action  by  converting  5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone  to  3-alpha-
   androstanediol.

   reduction  of 2,5-diketogluconic  acid  to  2-keto-L-gulonic  acid,  a  key
   intermediate in the production of ascorbic acid.
 - NAD(P)H-dependent  xylose  reductase  (EC  1.1.1.-)  from  the yeast Pichia
   stipitis. This enzyme reduces xylose into xylit.
 - Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.1.20).

   of 4,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone.
 - Frog eye lens rho crystallin.
 - Yeast GCY protein, whose function is not known.
 - Leishmania  major P110/11E protein. P110/11E is a developmentally regulated

* Homoserine dehydrogenase signature *
**************************************

Homoserine dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.3)  (HDh)  [1,2]  catalyzes NAD-dependent
reduction of  aspartate  beta-semialdehyde into  homoserine.  This reaction is
the third step in a   pathway leading from aspartate to homoserine. The latter
participates in  the  biosynthesis of threonine and then isoleucine as well as
in that of methionine.

HDh is  found  either as a single chain protein as in some bacteria and yeast,
or as a bifunctional  enzyme consisting  of an N-terminal aspartokinase domain
and a  C-terminal  HDh  domain  as in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and in
plants.

As a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region of Hdh.  This is
a segment  of  23  to  24  residues  located  in  the central section and that
contains two conserved aspartate residues.

* FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signatures *
***************************************************************

FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) (GPD) catalyzes
the conversion  of  glycerol-3-phosphate  into  dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In
bacteria [1]  it  is  associated  with  the utilization of glycerol coupled to
respiration. In  Escherichia coli, two isozymes are known: one expressed under
anaerobic conditions (gene glpA) and one in aerobic conditions (gene glpD). In
eukaryotes, a mitochondrial form of GPD participates in the glycerol phosphate
shuttle in conjunction with  an NAD-dependent cytoplasmic GPD (EC 1.1.1.8) [2,
3].

These enzymes  are  proteins  of  about  60  to 70 Kd which contain a probable
FAD-binding domain in their N-terminal extremity. The mammalian enzyme differs
from  the  bacterial  or  yeast proteins by having an  EF-hand calcium-binding
region (See <PDOC00018>) in its C-terminal extremity.

We developed  two  signature patterns. One based on the first half of the FAD-
binding  domain and one which corresponds to a conserved region in the central
part of these enzymes.

electron oxidation of L-histidinol to histidine.

In bacteria HDH is a single chain  polypeptide;  in fungi it is the C-terminal

L-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) (LDH) [1]  catalyzes the reversible NAD-
dependent interconversion of pyruvate to L-lactate.  In vertebrate muscles and
in lactic  acid bacteria it represents the final step in anaerobic glycolysis.
This tetrameric enzyme is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In
vertebrates there  are  three  isozymes  of  LDH:  the  M  form (LDH-A), found
predominantly in muscle tissues; the H form (LDH-B), found in heart muscle and
the X  form  (LDH-C),  found  only in the spermatozoa of mammals and birds. In
birds and  crocodilian eye lenses, LDH-B serves as a structural protein and is
known as epsilon-crystallin [2].

L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (L-hicDH) [3]  catalyzes the
reversible and stereospecific  interconversion  between 2-ketocarboxylic acids
and L-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids. L-hicDH is evolutionary related to LDH's.

As a signature for LDH's we have  selected  a region that includes a conserved
histidine which is essential to the catalytic mechanism.

* D-isomer specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases signatures *
*************************************************************

A number  of  NAD-dependent 2-hydroxyacid  dehydrogenases  which  seem  to  be
specific for the D-isomer of their substrate  have  been shown [1,2,3,4] to be
functionally and structurally related. These enzymes are listed below.

 - D-lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.28), a  bacterial  enzyme which catalyzes
   the reduction of D-lactate to pyruvate.
 - D-glycerate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.1.1.29)   (NADH-dependent  hydroxypyruvate
   reductase), a plant leaf peroxisomal enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of
   hydroxypyruvate  to  glycerate.  This  reaction  is  part  of the glycolate
   pathway of photorespiration.
 - D-glycerate dehydrogenase from the bacteria Hyphomicrobium methylovorum and
   Methylobacterium extorquens.
 - 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.1.1.95), a  bacterial  enzyme  that
   catalyzes the oxidation of D-3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate.
   This reaction  is  the first committed step in the 'phosphorylated' pathway
   of serine biosynthesis.
 - Erythronate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (gene pdxB), a bacterial
   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyridoxine (vitamin B6).
 - D-2-hydroxyisocaproate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-) (D-hicDH),  a  bacterial
   enzyme that catalyzes  the  reversible  and stereospecific  interconversion
   between 2-ketocarboxylic acids and D-2-hydroxy-carboxylic acids.
 - Formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2) (FDH) from  the bacteria Pseudomonas sp.
   101 and various fungi [5].
 - Vancomycin  resistance protein vanH from Enterococcus faecium; this protein
   is a  D-specific alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase involved in the formation of
   a peptidoglycan  which  does  not  terminate  by  D-alanine thus preventing
   vancomycin binding.

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycdW.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yiaE.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI1556.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER081w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIL074w.

All these enzymes  have  similar enzymatic  activities  and  are  structurally
related.  We  have  selected  three  of  the  most conserved  regions of these
proteins to develop patterns.  The  first  pattern  is based on a glycine-rich
region located in the central section of these enzymes,  this  region probably
corresponds to the NAD-binding domain. The two other patterns contain a number
of conserved charged residues,  some of which may play a role in the catalytic
mechanism.

3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.31) catalyzes the  NAD-dependent,
reversible oxidation of 3-hydroxbutyrate to methylmalonate [1]. In eukaryotes,
it is a homodimeric mitochondrial protein  involved in valine catabolism.   In
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  [2]  (gene  mmsB), it is involved in the distal valine
metabolic pathway.

The sequence   of   3-hydroxyisobutyrate  dehydrogenase  from  eukaryotic  and
prokaryotic sources  show  that this enzyme has been well conserved throughout
evolution. The following proteins are evolutionary related to 3-hydroxyisobut-
yrate dehydrogenase:

 - Escherichia  coli  2-hydroxy-3-oxopropionate reductase (EC 1.1.1.60) (genes
   garR and glxR).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygbJ.

 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ykwC.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv0770.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr0229.

As a  signature  pattern, we  selected  a highly conserved glycine-rich region
located at  the  proteins'  N-terminus.  This  region  is probably involved in
binding NAD.

* Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase signatures and profile *
*********************************************************************

Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase  (EC 1.1.1.34)  (HMG-CoA reductase)
[1,2] catalyzes the NADP-dependent  synthesis  of mevalonate from 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-CoA.   In vertebrates, HMG-CoA  reductase  is the rate-limiting
enzyme in  cholesterol biosynthesis. In plants, mevalonate is the precursor of
all isoprenoid compounds.

HMG-CoA reductase  is a membrane bound enzyme.  Structurally, it consists of 3
domains. An N-terminal region that contains a variable number of transmembrane
segments (7 in mammals, insects and fungi; 2 in plants), a linker region and a
C-terminal catalytic domain of approximately 400 amino-acid residues.

In archebacteria  [3] HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the biosynthesis
of the isoprenoids side chains of lipids, seems to be cytoplasmic and lack the
N-terminal hydrophobic domain.

Some bacteria, such  as Pseudomonas mevalonii, can  use mevalonate as the sole
carbon source.   These   bacteria   use  an  NAD-dependent  HMG-CoA  reductase
(EC 1.1.1.88)  to  deacetylate  mevalonate into 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
[3]. The Pseudomonas enzyme is structurally  related  to  the catalytic domain
of NADP-dependent HMG-CoA reductases.

We selected   three  conserved  regions  as  signature  patterns  for  HMG-CoA
reductases. The  first  is  located in the center of the catalytic domain, the
second is  a glycine-rich region located in the C-terminal section of the same
catalytic domain  and  the third is also located in the C-terminal section and
contains an histidine residue that seems [4] to be implicated in the catalytic
mechanism as a general base.

3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) (HCDH) [1] is an enzyme involved
in fatty acid metabolism,  it catalyzes the reduction  of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to
3-oxoacyl-CoA. Most eukaryotic cells have 2 fatty-acid beta-oxidation systems,
one located in  mitochondria and  the  other in peroxisomes.   In  peroxisomes
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA  dehydrogenase  forms,  with  enoyl-CoA  hydratase (ECH) and
3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase (ECI)  a  multifunctional  enzyme  where  the N-
terminal domain bears the hydratase/isomerase  activities  and  the C-terminal
domain the  dehydrogenase  activity.  There are two mitochondrial enzymes: one
which is   monofunctional   and  the  other  which is,  like  its  peroxisomal
counterpart, multifunctional.

In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA) HCDH is part
of a multifunctional enzyme which also contains an ECH/ECI domain as well as a
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [2].

The other proteins structurally related to HCDH are:

 - Bacterial  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.157) which reduces
   3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA [3].
 - Eye  lens  protein  lambda-crystallin [4], which is specific to lagomorphes
   (such as rabbit).

There are two major region of similarities in the sequences of proteins of the
HCDH family, the  first one located in the N-terminal, corresponds to the NAD-
binding site, the second one is located in the center of the sequence. We have
chosen to derive a signature pattern from this central region.

* Malic enzymes signature *

Malic enzymes,    or    malate   oxidoreductases,   catalyze   the   oxidative
decarboxylation of  malate  into  pyruvate  important  for  a  wide  range  of
metabolic pathways. There are three related forms of malic enzyme [1,2,3]:

 - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.38), which uses preferentially NAD and
   has the  ability  to  decarboxylate  oxaloacetate  (OAA).  It  is  found in
   bacteria and insects.
 - NAD-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.39), which uses preferentially NAD and
   is unable  to decarboxylate OAA. It is found in the mitochondrial matrix of
   plants and is a heterodimer of highly related subunits.
 - NADP-dependent  malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), which has a preference for NADP
   and has  the  ability  to  decarboxylate  OAA.  This form has been found in
   fungi, animals  and  plants.  In  mammals,  there  are  two  isozymes: one,
   mitochondrial and  the  other,  cytosolic.  Plants  also have two isozymes:
   chloroplastic and cytosolic.

There are  two  other proteins which are closely structurally related to malic
enzymes:

 - Escherichia coli protein sfcA, whose  function  is not yet known  but which
   could be an NAD or NADP-dependent malic enzyme.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKL029c, a probable malic enzyme.

There are  three  well  conserved regions in the enzyme sequences. Two of them
seem to be involved in binding NAD or NADP. The significance of the third one,
located in the central part of the enzymes, is not yet known. We selected this
region as a signature pattern for these enzymes.

* Isocitrate and isopropylmalate dehydrogenases signature *
***********************************************************

Isocitrate dehydrogenase  (IDH) [1,2] is an  important  enzyme of carbohydrate
metabolism which catalyzes  the  oxidative  decarboxylation of isocitrate into
alpha-ketoglutarate. IDH is either dependent on NAD+ (EC 1.1.1.41) or on NADP+
(EC 1.1.1.42). In eukaryotes there are at least three isozymes of IDH: two are
located in  the  mitochondrial matrix  (one NAD+-dependent,  the  other NADP+-
dependent), while the  third  one  (also NADP+-dependent) is  cytoplasmic.  In
Escherichia coli the  activity  of  a  NADP+-dependent form  of  the enzyme is
controlled by the phosphorylation of a serine residue; the phosphorylated form
of IDH is completely inactivated.

3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.85) (IMDH) [3,4] catalyzes the third
step in the  biosynthesis of leucine in  bacteria  and   fungi, the  oxidative
decarboxylation of 3-isopropylmalate into 2-oxo-4-methylvalerate.

Tartrate dehydrogenase  (EC  1.1.1.93) [5] catalyzes the reduction of tartrate
to oxaloglycolate.

These enzymes are evolutionary related [1,3,4,5]. The best conserved region of
these enzymes is  a glycine-rich stretch of residues located in the C-terminal
section. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

IMP dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.205)  (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction
of de novo GTP biosynthesis,  the NAD-dependent reduction of IMP into XMP [1].
Inhibition  of  IMP  dehydrogenase  activity  results  in the cessation of DNA
synthesis. As IMP dehydrogenase is associated with cell proliferation, it is a
possible target for cancer chemotherapy.  Mammalian  and  bacterial IMPDHs are
tetramers of identical chains.  There are  two  IMP  dehydrogenase isozymes in
humans [2].

GMP reductase (EC 1.6.6.8)  catalyzes  the  irreversible  and  NADPH-dependent
reductive deamination  of GMP into IMP [3]. It converts nucleobase, nucleoside
and nucleotide derivatives of G to A  nucleotides, and maintains intracellular
balance of A and G nucleotides.

IMP dehydrogenase and GMP reductase share many regions of sequence similarity.
One of  these  regions  is  centered  on  a cysteine residue thought [3] to be
involved in binding IMP. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

Pyrrolo-quinoline quinone (PQQ) is  redox coenzyme, which serves as a cofactor
for a number of enzymes (quinoproteins)  and  particularly  for some bacterial
dehydrogenases [1,2].    A number of these bacterial quinoproteins are clearly
evolutionary related. These proteins are listed below.

 - Methanol dehydrogenases (MDH) (EC 1.1.99.8), from methylotrophs.
 - Ethanol dehydrogenases from Acetobacter aceti [3].
 - Glucose dehydrogenase   (EC 1.1.99.17)  from   Acinetobacter calcoaceticus,
   Escherichia coli, and Gluconobacter oxydans [4].

These dehydrogenases all have from 600 to 800 amino acids.  We  developed  two
signature patterns for these  proteins using sequence data from well conserved
regions: the first one is located in  the N-terminal half while the second one
is from the C-terminal half.

* FMN-dependent alpha-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases active site *
***************************************************************

A number of oxidoreductases that act  on  alpha-hydroxy  acids  and  which are
FMN-containing  flavoproteins have  been  shown  [1,2,3]  to  be  structurally
related; these enzymes are:

 - Lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.2.3),   which  consists  of  a  dehydrogenase
   domain and a heme-binding domain  called  cytochrome b2 and which catalyzes
   the conversion of lactate into pyruvate.
 - Glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) ((S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase), a peroxisomal
   enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of  glycolate and oxygen to glyoxylate
   and hydrogen peroxide.
 - Long chain alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase from rat (EC 1.1.3.15), a peroxisomal
   enzyme.
 - Lactate 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.13.12.4) (lactate oxidase) from Mycobacterium
   smegmatis, which catalyzes the conversion of lactate and oxygen to acetate,
   carbon dioxide and water.
 - (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase  from  Pseudomonas  putida  (gene mdlB),  which
   catalyzes the reduction of (S)-mandelate to benzoylformate.

The first step in the reaction  mechanism of  these enzymes is the abstraction
of the proton from the  alpha-carbon of the  substrate  producing  a carbanion
which can subsequently  attach to the N5 atom of FMN.  A  conserved  histidine
has been shown [4] to  be  involved in the removal of the proton.  The  region
around this active site residue  is  highly conserved and contains an arginine
residue which is involved in substrate binding.

 - Glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) (GOX) from Aspergillus niger.
   Reaction catalyzed: glucose  +  oxygen ->  delta-gluconolactone +  hydrogen
   peroxide.
 - Methanol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.13) (MOX) from fungi.

   reduced acceptor.
 - Glucose dehydrogenase (GLD) (EC 1.1.99.10) from Drosophila.
   Reaction catalyzed: glucose  +  unknown acceptor ->  delta-gluconolactone +
   reduced acceptor.
 - Cholesterol oxidase (CHOD) (EC 1.1.3.6)  from Brevibacterium sterolicum and
   Streptomyces strain SA-COO.
   Reaction catalyzed: cholesterol + oxygen ->  cholest-4-en-3-one  + hydrogen
   peroxide.
 - AlkJ [3],  an  alcohol  dehydrogenase   from  Pseudomonas oleovorans, which
   converts aliphatic medium-chain-length alcohols into aldehydes.
 - Cellobiose    dehydrogenase   (CDH)   (EC   1.1.5.1)   from   Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium.

This family also includes a lyase:

 - (R)-mandelonitrile lyase (EC 4.1.2.10) (hydroxynitrile lyase)  from  plants
   [4], an enzyme involved in cyanogenis, the release of hydrogen cyanide from
   injured tissues.

These enzymes are  proteins  of size ranging from 556 (CHD) to 664 (MOX) amino
acid residues which share a number of regions of sequence similarities. One of
these regions, located in the N-terminal section,  corresponds to the FAD ADP-

we have selected two of these domains as signature patterns.  The first one is
located in  the N-terminal  section of these  enzymes, about 50 residues after
the ADP-binding  domain,  while  the  second  one  is  located  in the central
section.

* Eukaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signature *
******************************************************

A number of   different  eukaryotic  oxidoreductases  that require  and bind a
molybdopterin cofactor have  been shown [1] to share a few regions of sequence
similarity. These enzymes are:

 - Xanthine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.204),  which catalyzes  the   oxidation of
   xanthine to uric acid with  the concomitant reduction of NAD. Structurally,
   this enzyme  of about 1300 amino acids consists of at least three  distinct
   domains: an   N-terminal  2Fe-2S ferredoxin-like iron-sulfur binding domain
   (see <PDOC00175>),  a  central  FAD/NAD-binding domain and a C-terminal Mo-
   pterin domain.
 - Aldehyde oxidase (EC 1.2.3.1), which catalyzes the oxidation aldehydes into
   acids. Aldehyde  oxidase is highly similar to xanthine dehydrogenase in its
   sequence and domain structure.
 - Nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), which  catalyzes  the  reduction of nitrate
   to nitrite.  Structurally, this enzyme of about 900 amino acids consists of
   an N-terminal Mo-pterin domain,  a central cytochrome b5-type  heme-binding
   domain (see <PDOC00170>)  and  a   C-terminal  FAD/NAD-binding   cytochrome
   reductase domain.
 - Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), which  catalyzes  the oxidation of sulfite to
   sulfate. Structurally, this enzyme of about 460 amino acids  consists of an
   N-terminal cytochrome b5-binding domain followed by a Mo-pterin domain.

There are a few conserved regions in the sequence of the molybdopterin-binding
domain of  these enzymes. The pattern we use to detect these proteins is based
on one  of  them.  It  contains  a cysteine residue which could be involved in
binding the molybdopterin cofactor.

* Prokaryotic molybdopterin oxidoreductases signatures *
********************************************************

A number of  different  prokaryotic  oxidoreductases  that require  and bind a
molybdopterin cofactor have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number of regions of
sequence similarity. These enzymes are:

 - Escherichia coli respiratory nitrate  reductase (EC 1.7.99.4).  This enzyme
   complex allows the bacteria  to  use nitrate as an electron acceptor during
   anaerobic growth.  The enzyme is composed of three different chains: alpha,
   beta  and gamma.  The alpha chain (gene narG)  is the molybdopterin-binding
   subunit.  Escherichia coli  encodes for  a second, closely related, nitrate
   reductase complex  which also contains a  molybdopterin-binding alpha chain
   (gene narZ).
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide  reductase  (DMSO reductase).
   DMSO reductase is the terminal reductase during anaerobic growth on various
   sulfoxide  and N-oxide compounds.  DMSO  reductase  is  composed  of  three
   chains: A, B and C. The A chain (gene dmsA) binds molybdopterin.
 - Escherichia  coli  biotin  sulfoxide reductases (genes bisC and bisZ). This
   enzyme reduces  a  spontaneous  oxidation  product  of biotin, BDS, back to
   biotin. It  may  serve  as  a  scavenger,  allowing  the cell to use biotin
   sulfoxide as a biotin source.
 - Methanobacterium formicicum formate  dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2).  The alpha
   chain (gene fdhA) of this dimeric enzyme binds a molybdopterin cofactor.
 - Escherichia coli formate dehydrogenases -H (gene fdhF), -N (gene fdnG)  and
   -O (gene fdoG).  These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of formate
   to carbon  dioxide.  In  addition   to molybdopterin, the alpha (catalytic)
   subunit also contains an active site, selenocysteine.
 - Wolinella  succinogenes  polysulfide reductase  chain.   This  enzyme  is a
   component of the phosphorylative electron transport system with polysulfide
   as the  terminal acceptor. It is composed of three chains: A, B and C.  The
   A chain (gene psrA) binds molybdopterin.
 - Salmonella typhimurium thiosulfate reductase (gene phsA).
 - Escherichia coli trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase  (EC 1.6.6.9) (gene torA)
   [4].
 - Nitrate  reductase  (EC  1.7.99.4)  from Klebsiella pneumoniae (gene nasA),
   Alcaligenes eutrophus,    Escherichia    coli,   Rhodobacter   sphaeroides,
   Thiosphaera pantotropha  (gene  napA),  and  Synechococcus  PCC  7942 (gene
   narB).

These proteins range from 715 amino acids (fdhF) to 1246 amino acids (narZ) in
size.

We derived three signature patterns for these enzymes. The first is based on a
conserved region  in the N-terminal section and contains two cysteine residues
perhaps involved  in  binding  the molybdopterin cofactor. It should  be noted
that this region is not present in bisC.  The second pattern is derived from a
conserved region located in the central part of these enzymes.

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.3 and EC 1.2.1.5)  are enzymes which oxidize
a wide variety of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes.  In mammals at least  four
different forms  of  the enzyme are known [1]: class-1 (or Ald C) a tetrameric
cytosolic enzyme, class-2 (or Ald M) a tetrameric mitochondrial enzyme, class-
3 (or Ald D) a dimeric  cytosolic  enzyme,  and  class IV a microsomal enzyme.
Aldehyde  dehydrogenases  have  also  been sequenced from fungal and bacterial
species.  A number of enzymes are known to be evolutionary related to aldehyde
dehydrogenases; these enzymes are listed below.

 - Plants and bacterial  betaine-aldehyde  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.2.1.8) [2], an
   enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of betaine.
 - Plants     and    bacterial    NADP-dependent    glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
   dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.9).
 - Escherichia coli succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.16)
   (gene gabD) [3], which reduces succinate semialdehyde into succinate.
 - Escherichia coli lactaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.22) (gene ald) [4].

reductase (Frd) is used in anaerobic growth, and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh)

The flavoprotein subunit is  a  protein  of  about 60 to 70 Kd to which FAD is

* Alanine dehydrogenase and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase signatures *
*****************************************************************************

The following   dehydrogenases   have  been  shown [1]  to  share  regions  of
similarity:

 - Alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1),  an enzyme  which  catalyzes  the  NAD-
   dependent reversible reductive amination of pyruvate into alanine.
 - Pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1), which is the enzyme that
   catalyzes the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH with the concomitant oxidation of
   NADH to NAD+. This enzyme is located  in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes
   and  in  the  inner  membrane  of  the  mitochondria  of  eukaryotes.   The
   transhydrogenation between NADH and NADP is coupled with the  translocation
   of a proton across the membrane.  In prokaryotes  the enzyme is composed of
   two different subunits:  an alpha chain (gene pntA)  and a beta chain (gene
   pntB) while in eukaryotes it is a single chain protein.

The sequence  of  alanine  dehydrogenase  from  several  bacterial species are
related with  those of the  alpha subunit  of  bacterial  pyridine  nucleotide
transhydrogenase and of the N-terminal half of the eukaryotic enzyme.  The two
most conserved regions correspond respectively  to the N-terminal extremity of
these proteins and  to  a  central  glycine-rich  region  which is part of the
NAD(H)-binding site. We have developed signature patterns for both regions.

 - Glutamate  dehydrogenases  (EC 1.4.1.2, EC 1.4.1.3, and EC 1.4.1.4) (GluDH)
   are enzymes that catalyze the NAD- or NADP-dependent reversible deamination
   of glutamate into  alpha-ketoglutarate [1,2]. GluDH isozymes are  generally
   involved with either ammonia assimilation or glutamate catabolism.
 - Leucine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.9) (LeuDH) is a  NAD-dependent enzyme  that
   catalyzes the reversible deamination of leucine and several other aliphatic
   amino acids to their keto analogues [3].
 - Phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.20) (PheDH) is a NAD-dependent enzyme
   that catalyzes the  reversible deamidation of  L-phenylalanine into phenyl-
   pyruvate [4].
 - Valine  dehydrogenase  (EC 1.4.1.8) (ValDH) is a NADP-dependent enzyme that
   catalyzes the  reversible   deamidation   of   L-valine   into  3-methyl-2-
   oxobutanoate [5].

These  dehydrogenases  are structurally and functionally related.  A conserved
lysine  residue located in a  glycine-rich  region has been  implicated in the
catalytic mechanism. The conservation of the region around this residue allows
the derivation of a signature pattern for such type of enzymes.

D-amino acid  oxidase  (EC  1.4.3.3) (DAMOX or DAO) is an FAD flavoenzyme that
catalyzes the  oxidation  of  neutral  and  basic  D-amino  acids  into  their
corresponding keto  acids. DAOs have been characterized and sequenced in fungi
and vertebrates where they are known to be located in the peroxisomes.

D-aspartate oxidase  (EC  1.4.3.1)  (DASOX)  [1]  is  an  enzyme, structurally
related to  DAO,  which  catalyzes the same reaction but is active only toward
dicarboxylic D-amino acids.

In DAO, a  conserved  histidine  has  been  shown  [2] to be important for the
enzyme's catalytic  activity.    We have used the conserved region around this
residue as a signature pattern for these enzymes.

Amine oxidases  (AO)  [1]  are  enzymes  that catalyze the oxidation of a wide
range of  biogenic  amines  including  many  neurotransmitters,  histamine and
xenobiotic amines.  There are two classes of amine oxidases: flavin-containing
(EC 1.4.3.4) and copper-containing (EC 1.4.3.6).

Copper-containing AO is found in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, it is an
homodimeric enzyme  that  binds one copper ion per subunit as well as a 2,4,5-
trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (or topaquinone) (TPQ) cofactor. This cofactor
is derived from a tyrosine residue.

We have  derived  two signature patterns for copper AO, the first one contains
the tyrosine  which  give  rises  to  the  TPQ  cofactor  while the second one
contains one of the three histidines that bind the copper atom [2].

Lysyl oxidase   (EC 1.4.3.13) (LOX) [1] is  an  extracellular copper-dependent
enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of peptidyl lysine residues in
precursors of various collagens and elastins.  The deaminated lysines are then

* Tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase signatures *
************************************************************

Enzymes that participate in the transfer of  one-carbon  units are involved in
various biosynthetic pathways. In many of  these  processes  the  transfers of
one-carbon units are mediated by the coenzyme  tetrahydrofolate (THF). Various
reactions generate one-carbon derivatives of THF  which can be  interconverted
between   different  oxidation  states  by  formyltetrahydrofolate  synthetase
(EC 6.3.4.3),   methylenetetrahydrofolate   dehydrogenase   (EC   1.5.1.5   or
EC 1.5.1.15) and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9).

The dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities are expressed  by a variety of
multifunctional enzymes:

 - Eukaryotic C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (C1-THF synthase), which catalyzes
   all three reactions  described above.  Two  forms  of C1-THF synthases  are
   known [1],  one  is  located in the mitochondrial matrix,  while the second
   one is cytoplasmic. In  both forms the  dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase domain
   is located in the N-terminal  section  of  the 900 amino acids protein  and
   consists of about 300 amino acid residues.  The  C1-THF synthases are NADP-
   dependent.
 - Eukaryotic  mitochondrial  bifunctional  dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase  [2].
   This is  an  homodimeric  NAD-dependent  enzyme  of  about  300  amino acid
   residues.
 - Bacterial  folD  [3].  FolD  is  an homodimeric bifunctional NADP-dependent
   enzyme of about 290 amino acid residues.

The sequence of the dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase  domain  is highly  conserved
in all forms of the enzyme.   As signature patterns  we selected two conserved
regions.  The first one is located in the N-terminal part of these enzymes and
contains three  acidic  residues.   The second pattern  is  a highly conserved
sequence of 9 amino acids which is located in the C-terminal section.

Some oxygen-dependent   oxidoreductases  are  flavoproteins  that  contains  a
covalently bound  FAD  group  which is attached to a histidine via an 8-alpha-
(N3-histidyl)-riboflavin linkage. These proteins are:

 - 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine  oxidase (EC 1.5.3.6) (6-HDNO) [1], a bacterial enzyme
   that catalyzes  the  oxygen-dependent degradation of 6-hydroxynicotine into
   6-hydroxypyrid-N-methylosmine
 - Plant   reticuline   oxidase  (EC 1.5.3.9)  [2]   (berberine-bridge-forming
   enzyme), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of (S)-reticuline into (S)-
   scoulerine in the pathway leading to benzophenanthridine alkaloids.
 - L-gulonolactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.8)  (l-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase) [3],
   a mammalian enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of L-gulono-1,4-lactone to
   L-xylo-hexulonolactone which spontaneously isomerizes to L-ascorbate.
 - D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.24) (L-galactonolactone oxidase),
   a yeast enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of D-erythroascorbic acid [4].
 - Mitomycin  radical  oxidase  [5], a bacterial protein involved in mitomycin
   resistance and that probably oxidizes the reduced form of mitomycins.
 - Rhodococcus fascians fasciation locus protein fas5.

The region around the histidine that binds the FAD group is conserved in these
enzymes and can be used as a signature pattern.

Among the 25 to 30 polypeptide  subunits  of  this bioenergetic enzyme complex

 - Nuclear encoded, as a precursor form with a transit peptide in mammals, and
   in Neurospora crassa.
 - Mitochondrial encoded in Paramecium (gene psbG).
 - Chloroplast encoded in various higher plants (gene ndhK or psbG).

The 20 Kd subunit is highly similar to [4]:

 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 proteins psbG1 and psbG2.

********************************************************************

Nitrite reductases (NiR) [1]  catalyze the reduction of nitrite into ammonium,
the second step in  the assimilation of nitrate.   There are two types of NiR:
the higher plant chloroplastic form of NiR (EC 1.7.7.1) is a monomeric protein
that uses reduced ferredoxin as the electron donor; while fungal and bacterial
NiR (EC 1.6.6.4) are  homodimeric proteins  that  uses NAD(P)H as the electron
donor. Both forms of NiR contain a siroheme-Fe and iron-sulfur centers.

Sulfite reductase    (NADPH)  (EC  1.8.1.2)  (SIR) [2] is the bacterial enzyme
that catalyzes  the  reduction  of  sulfite  to  sulfide. SIR is an oligomeric
enzyme with  a subunit composition of alpha(8)-beta(4), the alpha component is
a flavoprotein  (SIR-FP),  while the beta component is a siroheme, iron-sulfur
protein (SIR-HP).

Sulfite reductase (ferredoxin) (EC 1.8.7.1) [3] is  a cyanobacterial and plant
monomeric enzyme that also catalyzes the reduction of sulfite to sulfide.

Anaerobic sulfite  reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) (ASR) [4],  a  bacterial enzyme that
catalyzes  the NADH-dependent   reduction  of  sulfite  to sulfide.  ASR is an
oligomeric enzyme composed of three different subunits.  The C component (gene
asrC) seems to be a siroheme, iron-sulfur protein.

These enzymes share  a region of sequence similarity in their C-terminal half;
this  region which spans about 80 amino acids includes four conserved cysteine
residues. Two of the Cys are grouped together  at the beginning of the domain,
and the  two    others  are grouped in the middle of the domain. The cysteines
are involved in the binding of the iron-sulfur center; the last one also binds
the siroheme group [2].

We have derived a signature  pattern from the region around the second cluster
of cysteines.

* Heme-copper oxidase subunit I, copper B binding region signature *
********************************************************************

Heme-copper respiratory  oxidases [1] are oligomeric integral membrane protein
complexes that  catalyze  the  terminal  step  in  the respiratory chain: they
transfer electrons  from  cytochrome  c  or  a quinol to oxygen. Some terminal
oxidases generate  a  transmembrane proton gradient across the plasma membrane
(prokaryotes) or  the  mitochondrial inner  membrane  (eukaryotes). The enzyme
complex consists of 3-4 subunits (prokaryotes) up to 13 polypeptides (mammals)
of which only the catalytic subunit (equivalent to mammalian subunit 1 (CO I))
is found in all heme-copper respiratory oxidases. The presence of a bimetallic
center (formed by a high-spin  heme and  copper B) as well as a low-spin heme,
both ligated to six conserved  histidine residues near the  outer side of four
transmembrane spans within CO I is common to all family members [2-4].

In contrary to  eukaryotes the respiratory chain of prokaryotes is branched to
multiple terminal  oxidases.  The  enzyme  complexes  vary  in heme and copper
composition, substrate  type and substrate affinity. The different respiratory
oxidases  allow  the cells to customize their  respiratory systems according a
variety of environmental growth conditions [1].

Recently also  a component of an anaerobic respiratory chain has been found to
contain  the copper B binding signature of this family: nitric oxide reductase
(NOR) exists in denitrifying species of Archae and Eubacteria.

Enzymes that belong to this family are:

 - Mitochondrial-type cytochrome c oxidase (EC  1.9.3.1) which uses cytochrome
   c as electron donor. The electrons are transferred via copper A (Cu(A)) and
   heme a  to  the  bimetallic  center  of  CO  I  that  is formed by a penta-
   coordinated heme   a     and  copper  B  (Cu(B)).  Subunit  1  contains  12
   transmembrane regions.  Cu(B)  is  said  to  be  ligated  to  three  of the
   conserved histidine  residues  within  the  transmembrane segments 6 and 7.
 - Quinol oxidase  from prokaryotes  that transfers electrons from a quinol to
   the binuclear  center  of  polypeptide I. This category of enzymes includes
   Escherichia coli cytochrome O terminal oxidase complex which is a component
   of the  aerobic respiratory chain that predominates when cells are grown at
   high aeration.
 - FixN,  the  catalytic  subunit  of  a  cytochrome  c  oxidase  expressed in
   nitrogen-fixing bacteroids  living  in  root nodules. The high affinity for
   oxygen allows oxidative phosphorylation under low  oxygen concentrations. A
   similar enzyme has been found in other purple bacteria.
 - Nitric oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.7) from Pseudomonas stutzeri. NOR reduces
   nitrate to  dinitrogen.  It  is  a  heterodimer  of  norC and the catalytic
   subunit norB. The latter contains the 6 invariant histidine residues and 12
   transmembrane segments [5].

As a signature pattern we used the copper-binding region.

* CO II and nitrous oxide reductase dinuclear copper centers signature *
************************************************************************

Cytochrome c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1)  [1,2] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex
which is  a component of the respiratory chain and is involved in the transfer
of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. In eukaryotes this enzyme complex is
located in  the  mitochondrial  inner  membrane;  in aerobic prokaryotes it is
found in  the  plasma  membrane.  The  enzyme complex consists of 3-4 subunits
(prokaryotes) to up to 13 polypeptides (mammals).

Subunit 2  (CO  II) transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to the catalytic
subunit 1.  It  contains  two adjacent transmembrane regions in its N-terminus
and the  major  part  of  the  protein is exposed to the periplasmic or to the
mitochondrial intermembrane space, respectively. CO II provides the substrate-
binding  site and contains a copper center called Cu(A),  probably the primary
acceptor in cytochrome c oxidase. An exception is the corresponding subunit of
the cbb3-type oxidase which lacks the copper A redox-center. Several bacterial
CO II have a C-terminal extension that contains a covalently bound heme c.

It has been shown [3,4] that nitrous oxide reductase (EC 1.7.99.6) (gene nosZ)
of Pseudomonas has sequence similarity in its C-terminus to CO II. This enzyme
is part of the bacterial respiratory system which is activated under anaerobic
conditions in  the presence of nitrate or nitrous oxide. NosZ is a periplasmic
homodimer that  contains  a  dinuclear copper center, probably located in a 3-
dimensional fold  similar  to the cupredoxin-like fold that has been suggested
for the copper-binding site of CO II [3].

The dinuclear  purple  copper center is formed by 2 histidines and 2 cysteines
[5]. We  used this region as a signature pattern. The conserved valine and the
conserved methionine are said to be involved in stabilizing the copper-binding
fold by interacting with each other.

* Heme-copper oxidase subunit III profile *
*******************************************

Cytochrome c  oxidase  (EC  1.9.3.1) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory
chain of  mitochondria and many aerobic bacteria. It catalyzes the transfer of
electrons from  reduced  cytochrome  c  to  molecular oxygen. This reaction is
coupled to  the pumping of four additional protons across the mitochondrial or
bacterial membrane [1].

Cytochrome c oxidase is an oligomeric enzymatic complex that is located in the
mitochondrial inner  membrane  of  eukaryotes  and  in  the plasma membrane of
aerobic prokaryotes.   The   core  structure  of  prokaryotic  and  eukaryotic
cytochrome c  oxidase  contains  three  common  subunits,  I,  II  and III. In
prokaryotes, subunits I and III can be fused and a fourth subunit is sometimes
found, whereas  in  eukaryotes there are a variable number of additional small
polypeptidic subunits  [2].  The  functional  role  of  subunit III is not yet
understood.

As the  bacterial  respiratory  systems  are  branched,  they have a number of
distinct terminal  oxidases,  rather  than  the  single  cytochrome  c oxidase
present in  the  eukaryotic  mitochondrial  systems. Although the cytochrome o
oxidases do not catalyze the cytochrome c but the quinol (ubiquinol) oxidation
they belong  to  the  same  heme-copper  oxidase  superfamily  as cytochrome c
oxidases. Members  of  this  family  share  sequence similarities in all three
core subunits:  subunit I is the most conserved subunit, whereas subunit II is
the least conserved [3,4,5].

Cytochrome c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) [1] is an oligomeric enzymatic complex which
is a component  of  the  respiratory  chain  complex  and is involved   in the
transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen.   In eukaryotes this enzyme
complex is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane; in aerobic prokaryotes
it is found in the plasma membrane.  In  addition  to the three large subunits
that form the catalytic center of the enzyme complex there are, in eukaryotes,
a variable number of small polypeptidic subunits.  One of these subunits which
is known as Vb in mammals, V in slime mold and IV in yeast, binds a zinc atom.
The sequence of subunit  Vb  is  well  conserved  and includes three conserved
cysteines  that  are  thought  to coordinate the zinc ion [2].  Two  of  these
cysteines are clustered in the C-terminal section of the subunit; we have used
this region as a signature pattern.

* Multicopper oxidases signatures *
***********************************

Multicopper oxidases [1,2] are enzymes  that possess  three  spectroscopically
different copper centers. These centers are called: type  1 (or  blue), type 2
(or  normal)  and type 3 (or  coupled binuclear).  The  enzymes that belong to
this family are:

 - Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2)  (urishiol oxidase), an enzyme  found  in  fungi  and
   plants, which oxidizes many different types of phenols and diamines.
 - Ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3), a higher plant enzyme.
 - Ceruloplasmin (EC 1.16.3.1) (ferroxidase), a protein  found in the serum of
   mammals and birds, which  oxidizes a great variety of inorganic and organic
   substances. Structurally ceruloplasmin exhibits internal sequence homology,
   and seem to  have  evolved from the triplication of a copper-binding domain
   similar to that found in laccase and ascorbate oxidase.

In addition to the above enzymes there are  a number of proteins which, on the
basis of sequence similarities, can  be said to belong to this  family.  These
proteins are:

 - Copper resistance protein A (copA)  from a plasmid in Pseudomonas syringae.
   This protein seems to  be involved in  the resistance of the microbial host
   to copper.
 - Blood coagulation factor V (Fa V).
 - Blood coagulation factor VIII (Fa VIII) [E1].
 - Yeast FET3 [3], which is required for ferrous iron uptake.
 - Yeast  hypothetical  protein  YFL041w  and  SpAC1F7.08,  the  fission yeast
   homolog.

Factors V and VIII act as cofactors in blood coagulation  and are structurally
similar [4]. Their sequence consists of a triplicated A domain, a B domain and
a duplicated C domain;  in the following order: A-A-B-A-C-C. The A-type domain
is related to the multicopper oxidases.

We have developed two signature patterns for these proteins. Both patterns are
derived  from the  same  region, which  in  ascorbate oxidase, laccase, in the
third domain of  ceruloplasmin,  and in copA,  contains five residues that are
known to be involved in the binding of copper centers.  The first pattern does
not make any assumption  on  the  presence of copper-binding residues and thus
can detect domains that have lost the ability to bind copper (such as those in
Fa V and Fa VIII),  while  the  second  pattern  is specific to copper-binding
domains.

* Peroxidases signatures *
**************************

Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.-) [1]  are  heme-binding  enzymes  that  carry  out  a
variety of biosynthetic and  degradative  functions using hydrogen peroxide as
the electron acceptor. Peroxidases are widely distributed throughout bacteria,
fungi, plants, and vertebrates.

In peroxidases the heme prosthetic group  is  protoporphyrin IX  and the fifth
ligand of the heme iron is a histidine  (known as the proximal histidine).  An
other histidine residue (the distal histidine) serves as an acid-base catalyst
in the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the enzyme.  The regions  around
these two active  site  residues  are  more or less conserved in a majority of
peroxidases [2,3].  The  enzymes in  which one or both of these regions can be
found are listed below.

 - Yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.5).
 - Myeloperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7)  (MPO).  MPO  is  found  in  granulocytes and
   monocytes and  plays  a  major  role  in  the oxygen-dependent microbicidal
   system of neutrophils.
 - Lactoperoxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) (LPO). LPO is a milk protein which acts as an
   antimicrobial agent.
 - Eosinophil  peroxidase  (EC 1.11.1.7)  (EPO).   An   enzyme  found  in  the
   cytoplasmic granules of eosinophils.
 - Thyroid peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.8) (TPO).  TPO  plays  a  central role in the
   biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. It  catalyzes the iodination and coupling
   of  the  hormonogenic  tyrosines in  thyroglobulin  to  yield  the  thyroid
   hormones T3 and T4.
 - Fungal ligninases. Ligninase catalyzes the first step in the degradation of
   lignin. It depolymerizes lignin by catalyzing the C(alpha)-C(beta) cleavage
   of the propyl side chains of lignin.
 - Plant peroxidases  (EC 1.11.1.7).   Plants  expresses  a  large numbers  of
   isozymes of peroxidases.  Some of them play a  role in cell-suberization by
   catalyzing the deposition of the  aromatic residues  of suberin on the cell
   wall, some are expressed as a defense response toward  wounding, others are
   involved in the metabolism of auxin and the biosynthesis of lignin.
 - Prokaryotic catalase-peroxidases.  Some  bacterial  species produce enzymes
   that exhibit both catalase  and  broad-spectrum  peroxidase activities [4].
   Examples  of  such  enzymes are:  catalase HP I from Escherichia coli (gene
   katG) and perA from Bacillus stearothermophilus.

Catalase (EC 1.11.1.6)  [1,2,3]  is an  enzyme, present in all aerobic  cells,
that decomposes  hydrogen  peroxide  to  molecular oxygen and water.  Its main
function is  to  protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. In
eukaryotic organisms and  in some  prokaryotes catalase is a molecule composed
of four identical subunits. Each of the subunits binds one protoheme IX group.

A conserved tyrosine serves as the heme proximal side ligand. We have used the
region around this residue  as a first signature pattern; it  also  includes a
conserved  arginine that participates in  heme-binding.  A conserved histidine
has been shown  to be important for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme.  We
have used the region around this residue as a second signature pattern.

* Glutathione peroxidases signatures *
**************************************

Glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) (GSHPx) [1,2] is an enzyme that catalyzes
the reduction  of  hydroxyperoxides  by  glutathione.  Its main function is to
protect against the damaging effect of endogenously formed hydroxyperoxides.

In higher vertebrates at  least  four  forms  of  GSHPx are  known to exist: a
ubiquitous cytosolic form (GSHPx-1), a  gastrointestinal cytosolic for (GSHPx-
GI) [3], a plasma secreted form (GSHPx-P) [4], and a epididymal secretory form
(GSHPx-EP). In  addition  to  these  characterized  forms,  the  sequence of a
protein of  unknown  function [5] has been shown to be evolutionary related to
those of GSHPx's.

In filarial  nematode  parasites  such  as  Brugia  pahangi  the major soluble
cuticular protein,  known  as  gp29, is a secreted GSHPx which could provide a
mechanism of  resistance  to  the  immune  reaction  of  the mammalian host by
neutralizing the products of the oxidative burst of leukocytes [6].

Escherichia coli protein btuE, a periplasmic protein involved in the transport
of vitamin B12, is also evolutionary related to GSHPx's;  the  significance of
this relationship is not yet clear.

The catalyic  site  of  GSHPx  contains  a conserved residue which is either a
cysteine or, in many eukaryotic GSHPx, a selenocysteine [7]. The region around
this active  site  residue  can  be  used  as a signature pattern. As a second
signature for   this  family  of  proteins  we  selected  a  highly  conserved
octapeptide located in the central section of these proteins.

* Lipoxygenases iron-binding region signatures *
************************************************

Lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.-)  are a   class of   iron-containing  dioxygenases
which catalyzes the  hydroperoxidation  of lipids,  containing  a cis,cis-1,4-
pentadiene structure.  They are common in plants where they may be involved in
a  number  of  diverse  aspects  of  plant  physiology  including  growth  and
development, pest resistance, and senescence or responses to wounding [1].  In
mammals a number of lipoxygenases  isozymes  are involved in the metabolism of
prostaglandins  and   leukotrienes [2].  Sequence  data  is  available for the
following lipoxygenases:

 - Plant lipoxygenases (EC 1.13.11.12). Plants express a variety  of cytosolic
   isozymes as well as what seems [3] to be a chloroplast isozyme.
 - Mammalian arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.34).
 - Mammalian arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.31).
 - Mammalian erythroid cell-specific 15-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.33).

The iron  atom  in  lipoxygenases is bound by four ligands, three of which are
histidine residues  [4].  Six  histidines  are  conserved  in all lipoxygenase
sequences, five  of  them  are found clustered in a stretch of 40 amino acids.
This region  contains two of the three zinc-ligands; the other histidines have
been shown [5] to be important for the activity of lipoxygenases.

As signatures for this family of  enzymes we have selected two patterns in the
region  of the histidine cluster.  The  first pattern contains the first three
conserved histidines and the second pattern includes the fourth and the fifth.

* Extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenases signature *
**************************************************

Dioxygenases catalyze the incorporation of both atoms of molecular oxygen into
substrates.  Cleavage of  aromatic rings is one of the most important function
of  dioxygenases.   The  substrates  of  ring-cleavage   dioxygenases  can  be
classified into two groups  according to the mode  of scission of the aromatic
ring. Intradiol enzymes  cleave the aromatic ring between two hydroxyl groups,
whereas  extradiol  enzymes cleave  the aromatic  ring between  a hydroxylated
carbon and another adjacent nonhydroxylated carbon. Extradiol dioxygenases are
usually homomultimeric,  bind  one  atom of ferrous ion per subunit and have a
subunit size  of about 33 Kd. It has been shown [1,2] that the known extradiol
dioxygenases are  evolutionary related. The enzymes that belong to this family
are:

 - Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase  (EC 1.13.11.2)  (metapyrocatechase)  (genes nahH,
   xylE, dmpB, mcpII, and pheB).
 - 3-methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene todE).
 - Biphenyl-2,3-diol  1,2-dioxygenase  (EC  1.13.11.39) (DHBD) (gene bphC). It
   should be noted that in Rhodococcus globerulus, three different isozymes of
   DHBD have been found (genes bphC1 to bphC3). bphC1 is a classical extradiol
   dioxygenase, but bphC2 and bphC3 are smaller proteins (189 residues).
 - 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene nahC).
 - 2,2',3-trihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (gene dbfB).

As a signature pattern for  these enzymes  we  selected a region that includes
four conserved  residues.  Among them is a glutamate which has been shown [3],
in bphC, to be implicated in the binding of the ferrous iron atom.

classified into two groups  according to the mode  of scission of the aromatic
ring. Intradiol enzymes  cleave the aromatic ring between two hydroxyl groups,
whereas extradiol  enzymes cleave  the aromatic  ring between  a  hydroxylated
carbon and another adjacent nonhydroxylated carbon [1]. Intradiol dioxygenases
require a nonheme  ferric ion as a cofactor.  The enzymes that  belong to this
family are:

 - Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase  (EC 1.13.11.3) (3,4-PCD),  an   oligomeric
   enzyme complex  which consists of  12 copies  each  of an alpha  and a beta
   subunits. Both subunits are evolutionary related.
 - Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1) (gene catA or clcA).
 - Chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1) (gene tfdC).

As a signature pattern for  these enzymes  we  selected a region that includes
a tyrosine residue which, in 3,4-PCD,  has been shown [2], to be implicated in
the binding of the ferric iron atom.

* Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase signatures *
******************************************

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.42) (IDO) [1] is an enzyme responsible
for the  conversion of tryptophan and other indole derivatives to kynurenines.
In mammals, IDO is induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and responsible for
some of  its  anti-proliferative  effects.  The  degradative  action of IDO on
tryptophan leads  to cell death by starvation of this essential and relatively
scarce amino acid. IDO is a heme-containing enzyme of about 400 amino acids.

Other proteins that are evolutionarily related to IDO are:

 - Myoglobin  from  the  red  muscle  of  the  gastropods  Nordotis madaka and
   Sulculus diversicolor  [2].  These  unusual globins lack enzymatic activity
   but have kept the heme group.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR078w.

As a  signature  for  the  IDO  family, we selected two conserved regions. The
first is  located    in  the central section and is rich in glycine and serine
residues; the  second  is  located  in  the  second  third of the sequence and
contains a  conserved  histidine  that could serve as a proximal ligand to the
heme iron.

*********************************************************************

Bacterial  ring  hydroxylating  dioxygenases   are   multicomponent  enzymatic
complexes  composed  of a  hydroxylase  component  and  an  electron  transfer
component. The hydroxylase component is  itself  composed  of two subunits: an
alpha-subunit of about 50 Kd, and a beta-subunit of about 20 Kd.  The electron
transfer component  is  either  composed of two subunits:  a  ferredoxin and a
ferredoxin reductase or by a single bifunctional ferredoxin/reductase subunit.

The alpha-subunit of hydroxylase components are evolutionary related [1].  The
currently known members of this family are listed below.

 - Benzene 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.3) (gene bnzA) from Pseudomonas putida.
 - phthalate 4,5-dioxygenase (EC 1.14.12.7) (gene pht3) from Pseudomonas.
 - Benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.10)  (gene benA)  from  Acinetobacter
   calcoaceticus.
 - Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.12) (gene ndoC) from Pseudomonas.
 - 3-chlorobenzoate-3,4-dioxygenase   (EC   1.14.12-.-)   (gene   cbaA)   from

 - Toluene 2,3-dioxygenase  (EC 1.14.12.-)   (gene todC1)   from   Pseudomonas
   putida.

The alpha-subunit of the hydroxylase components bind  both a 2Fe-2S type iron-
sulfur center and an iron atom.  There is,  in the N-terminal section of these
proteins, a conserved  region  of 24 residues which contains two cysteines and
two histidines  which have been shown [2] to be involved in the binding of the
iron-sulfur center. We have used this region has a signature pattern.

Biopterin-dependent  aromatic amino-acid hydroxylases [1]  are  iron-dependent
enzymes  that catalyze a mixed  oxidation  reaction.  This consumes  a reduced
biopterin cofactor  and molecular  oxygen for the hydroxylation of an aromatic
amino-acid substrate. Enzymes  that  belong  to  this  family,  and  for which
sequence data is available, are listed below.

 - Phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.1) (PAH).  Catalyzes the conversion
   of phenylalanine to tyrosine. In humans, deficiencies [2,E1] of PAH are the
   cause of  phenylketonuria,  the  most  common  inborn  error  of amino acid
   metabolism. In  the  bacteria Chromobacterium violaceum [3], PAH is copper-
   dependent; it is iron-dependent in Pseudomonas aeruginosa phhA [4].
 - Tyrosine 3-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2) (TYH). Catalyzes  the  rate  limiting
   step in  catecholamine  biosynthesis:  the  conversion of  tyrosine to 3,4-
   dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine.
 - Tryptophan 5-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4) (TRH). Catalyzes  the rate-limiting
   step in serotonin biosynthesis: the conversion  of tryptophan to 3-hydroxy-

Enzymes that  belong  to  this family are functionally as well as structurally
related [2].  Their size ranges from 296 residues for bacterial PAH, to  about
500 residues for eukaryotic PAH,  TYH and TRH. As a signature pattern for this

* Tyrosinase signatures *
*************************

Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) [1] is  a  copper  monooxygenases that catalyzes the
hydroxylation of  monophenols and the oxidation  of  o-diphenols to o-quinols.
This enzyme, found in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes, is involved in the
formation of pigments such as melanins and other polyphenolic compounds.

Tyrosinase binds two copper ions (CuA and CuB). Each of the two copper ion has
been shown [2] to be bound by three conserved histidines residues. The regions
around these copper-binding ligands are well conserved and also shared by some
hemocyanins, which are copper-containing oxygen carriers from the hemolymph of
many molluscs and arthropods [3,4].

At least two proteins related to tyrosinase are known to exist in mammals:

 - TRP-1 (TYRP1) [5], which is responsible for  the conversion of 5,6-dihydro-
   xyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) to indole-5,6-quinone-2-carboxylic acid.
 - TRP-2 (TYRP2) [6], which is  the  melanogenic enzyme DOPAchrome tautomerase
   (EC 5.3.3.12) that catalyzes the conversion of DOPAchrome to DHICA.   TRP-2
   differs from tyrosinases and TRP-1 in that  it binds  two zinc ions instead
   of copper [7].

Other proteins that belong to this family are:

 - Plants polyphenol oxidases (PPO) (EC 1.10.3.1) which catalyze the oxidation
   of mono- and o-diphenols to o-diquinones [8].
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein C02C2.1.

We have  derived  two  signature patterns for tyrosinase and related proteins.
The first one contains two of the histidines that bind CuA, and is  located in
the N-terminal section of tyrosinase.  The second pattern contains a histidine
that binds CuB, that pattern is located in the central section of the enzyme.

* Fatty acid desaturases signatures *

Fatty acid desaturases (EC 1.14.99.-)  are enzymes that catalyze the insertion
of a double bond at the delta position of fatty acids.

There seems to be two distinct families of fatty acid desaturases which do not
seem to be evolutionary related.

Family 1 is composed of:

 - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) (EC 1.14.99.5) [1].  SCD is  a key regulatory
   enzyme of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. SCD introduces a cis  double
   bond at the delta(9) position of fatty acyl-CoA's such as palmitoleoyl- and
   oleoyl-CoA. SCD is a membrane-bound enzyme that is thought to function as a
   part of a multienzyme  complex in the  endoplasmic reticulum of vertebrates
   and fungi.

As a signature pattern  for this family  we selected a conserved region in the
C-terminal part of these enzymes,  this region  is rich  in histidine residues
and in aromatic residues.

Family 2 is composed of:

 - Plants stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase  (EC 1.14.99.6) [2],  these
   enzymes catalyze the introduction of a double bond at the delta(9) position
   of steraoyl-ACP to produce oleoyl-ACP.  This enzyme  is responsible for the
   conversion of saturated  fatty  acids  to  unsaturated  fatty  acids in the
   synthesis of vegetable oils.
 - Cyanobacteria desA [3]  an  enzyme  that  can introduce a second cis double
   bond  at  the  delta(12)   position  of  fatty   acid  bound  to  membranes
   glycerolipids. DesA is involved in chilling tolerance; the phase transition
   temperature of lipids of cellular membranes being dependent on  the  degree
   of unsaturation of fatty acids of the membrane lipids.

As a signature pattern  for this family  we selected a conserved region in the
C-terminal part of these enzymes.

* Heme oxygenase signature *
****************************

Heme oxygenase  (EC 1.14.99.3) (HO) [1]  is  the  microsomal  enzyme  that, in
animals, carries out the oxidation of heme, it cleaves the  heme  ring  at the
alpha methene bridge  to  form biliverdin and  carbon monoxide.  Biliverdin is
subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.

In mammals there are three isozymes of heme oxygenase: HO-1 to HO-3. The first
two isozymes differ in their tissue expression and their inducibility: HO-1 is
highly inducible by its substrate  heme  and  by  various non-heme substances,
while HO-2  is  non-inducible.  It  has  been suggested [2] that HO-2 could be
implicated in  the production of carbon monoxide in the brain where it is said
to act as a neurotransmitter.

In the  genome  of  the  chloroplast of red algae as well as in cyanobacteria,
there is  a heme oxygenase (gene pbsA) that is the key enzyme in the synthesis
of the chromophoric part of the photosynthetic antennae [3]. An heme oxygenase
is also present in the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae (gene hmuO), where
it is involved in the acquisition of iron from the host heme [4].

There is,  in  the  central  section of these enzymes, a well conserved region
centered on  a  histidine  residue.  We  have  used this region as a signature
pattern.

Copper/Zinc superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) (SODC) [1] is  one of the three
forms of an enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals. SODC
binds one atom each  of zinc and copper.  Various forms  of  SODC are known: a
cytoplasmic  form in  eukaryotes, an additional chloroplast form in plants, an
extracellular form in some  eukaryotes, and a periplasmic form in prokaryotes.
The metal binding sites are conserved in all the known SODC sequences [2].

We derived two signature  patterns for this family of enzymes:  the  first one
contains two  histidine residues that  bind the copper atom; the second one is
located in the C-terminal section of  SODC  and  contains a  cysteine which is
involved in a disulfide bond.

Nitrogenase (EC 1.18.6.1) [1] is  the enzyme system responsible for biological
nitrogen fixation.  Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two
components:  component 2  is  an  homodimer  of  an iron-sulfur protein, while
component 1  which  contains  the active site for the reduction of nitrogen to
ammonia exists in three different forms:

 - A molybdenum-iron containing protein (MoFe). The MoFe protein is a  hetero-
   tetramer consisting of two pairs of alpha (nifD) and beta (nifK) subunits.
 - A vanadium-iron containing protein (VFe).   The VFe protein is a hexamer of
   two pairs each of alpha (vnfD), beta (vnfK), and delta (vnfG) subunits.
 - The third form of component 1 seems to only contain iron. Like the vanadium
   form it  is  a  hexamer  composed  of  alpha (anfD), beta (anfK), and delta
   (anfG) subunits.

The alpha and  beta  chains of the three types of component 1 are evolutionary
related and they are  also  related to proteins  nifE and nifN, which are most
probably involved in the iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis [2].

We selected as signature patterns for this family of proteins two stretches of

Nitrogenase (EC 1.18.6.1) [1] is  the enzyme system responsible for biological
nitrogen fixation.  Nitrogenase is an oligomeric complex which consists of two
components: component 1  which  contains  the active site for the reduction of
nitrogen to ammonia and component 2 (also called the iron protein).

Component 2 is a homodimer of a  protein (gene nifH) which binds a single 4Fe-
4S iron sulfur cluster [2]. In the  nitrogen fixation  process  nifH  is first
reduced by a protein  such as ferredoxin;  the reduced  protein then transfers
electrons to component 1 with the concomitant consumption of ATP.

A number of proteins  are  known  to  be  evolutionary related to nifH.  These
proteins are:

 - Chloroplast  encoded  frxC  (or  chlL) protein [3].  FrxC is encoded on the
   chloroplast genome of some plant species, its exact function  is not known,
   but it   could   act   as   an   electron  carrier  in  the  conversion  of
   protochlorophyllide to chlorophyllide.
 - Rhodobacter capsulatus  proteins  bchL  and bchX [4].  These  proteins  are
   also likely to play a role in chlorophyll synthesis.

There are a number of conserved regions in the sequence of  these proteins: in
the N-terminal section there is an ATP-binding  site motif 'A' (P-loop) and in
the central section there  are  two conserved cysteines which have been shown,
in nifH, to  be  the  ligands of the 4Fe-4S cluster.  We  have  developed  two
signatures patterns that correspond to the regions around these cysteines.

* Nickel-dependent hydrogenases large subunit signatures *
**********************************************************

Hydrogenases are enzymes that catalyze the  reversible  activation of hydrogen
and which occur widely in prokaryotes as well as in some eukaryotes. There are
various types of hydrogenases,  but  all  of them seem to contain at least one
iron-sulfur cluster. They can be broadly divided into two groups: hydrogenases
containing nickel and, in  some cases,  also selenium (the [NiFe] and [NiFeSe]
hydrogenases) and those lacking nickel (the [Fe] hydrogenases).

The [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases  are  heterodimer that consist of a small
subunit that  contains  a  signal  peptide  and a large subunit. All the known
large subunits seem to be evolutionary related [1]; they contain  two Cys-x-x-
Cys motifs; one  at  their N-terminal end;  the other at their C-terminal end.
These four  cysteines  are  involved  in  the  binding  of  nickel [2]. In the
[NiFeSe] hydrogenases  the  first  cysteine  of  the  C-terminal  motif  is  a
selenocysteine which  has experimentally been shown to be a nickel ligand [3].
We have developed two patterns which are centered on the Cys-x-x-Cys motifs.

Alcaligenes eutrophus  possess  a NAD-reducing cytoplasmic  hydrogenase (hoxS)
[4]; this enzyme is composed of four subunits. Two of these subunits (beta and
delta) are responsible  for  the hydrogenase  reaction  and  are  evolutionary
related to the large and small subunits of membrane-bound hydrogenases.

The alpha  subunit  of  coenzyme  F420  hydrogenase  (EC 1.12.99.1) (FRH) from
archaebacterial methanogens also belongs to this family.

* Glutamyl-tRNA reductase signature *
*************************************

Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is  the obligatory precursor for the synthesis
of  all tetrapyrroles  including porphyrin derivatives such as chlorophyll and
heme.  ALA can be synthesized  via  two different pathways: the Shemin (or C4)
pathway which involves  the  single  step  condensation  of  succinyl-CoA  and
glycine and which  is  catalyzed by ALA  synthase (EC 2.3.1.37) and via the C5
pathway from the five-carbon skeleton of glutamate.  The C5  pathway  operates
in the chloroplast of  plants and algae,  in cyanobacteria, in some eubacteria
and in archaebacteria.

The initial step in the C5 pathway is carried out  by  glutamyl-tRNA reductase
(GluTR) [1]  which  catalyzes  the  NADP-dependent  conversion  of  glutamate-
tRNA(Glu)  to  glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA) with  the concomitant release of
tRNA(Glu)  which  can  then  be  recharged  with  glutamate  by  glutamyl-tRNA
synthetase.

GluTR is a protein of about 50 Kd (467 to 550 residues)  which  contains a few
conserved region.  The best conserved region is located in positions 99 to 122
in the sequence of  known GluTR.  This region seems important for the activity
of the enzyme.  We have  developed a  signature  pattern  from  that conserved
region.

There are  two  glycine-rich  conserved regions, both of which probably play a

* NNMT/PNMT/TEMT family of methyltransferases signature *
*********************************************************

The following   cytoplasmic  vertebrate  methyltransferases  are  evolutionary
related [1]:

 - Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.1) (NNMT). NNMT catalyzes the N-
   methylation of  nicotinamide  and  other pyridines to form pyridinium ions.
   This activity  is  important  for  the  biotransformation of many drugs and
   xenobiotic compounds.
 - Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.28) (PNMT). PNMT catalyzes
   the last step in catecholamine biosynthesis, the conversion of noradrenalin
   to adrenalin.
 - Thioether  S-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.96)  (TEMT).  TEMT catalyzes the
   methylation of dimethyl sulfide into trimethylsulfonium.

These three enzymes use S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor.  They are
proteins of 30 to 32 Kd. As a signature pattern we selected the most conserved
region, a  stretch  of 16 residues which are located in the N-terminal section
of these enzymes.

* RNA methyltransferase trmA family signatures *
************************************************

In Escherichia coli, the trmA protein  is a tRNA (uracil-5-)-methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.35) that catalyzes the S-adenosylmethionine dependent methylation of
U54 in  all  tRNAs. Orthologs of trmA are found in many eubacterial species. A
number of uncharacterized homologs of trmA have been found [1]:

 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical protein ygcA and HI0333,  the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0958.
 - Chlamydia trachomatis protein HOM1.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC4G8.07c.

It is  probable  that  ygcA/HI0333 and HI0958 are probably responsible for the
methylation of  U747  and  U1939  in 23S rRNA. In trmA, a cysteine is known to
participate in  the  catalytic mechanism by forming a covalent adduct to C6 of
uracil.

We selected  two  conserved  regions as signature patterns, the first includes
the active  site  cysteine  and the second one, located at the C-terminal end,
contains a conserved histidine.

Thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45) [1,2]  catalyzes  the reductive methylation
of dUMP to dTMP with  concomitant conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
to dihydrofolate.   Thymidylate  synthase  plays  an  essential  role  in  DNA
synthesis and is an important target for certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

Thymidylate synthase is an  enzyme of about 30 to 35 Kd in most species except
in protozoan and plants where it exists as a bifunctional enzyme that includes
a dihydrofolate reductase domain.

A cysteine residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism (it covalently binds
the 5,6-dihydro-dUMP intermediate).   The  sequence  around the active site of
this enzyme is conserved from phages to vertebrates.

* Ribosomal RNA adenine dimethylases signature *
************************************************

A number  of  enzymes  responsible  for  the  dimethylation  of  adenosines in
ribosomal RNAs (EC 2.1.1.48) have been found [1,2] to be evolutionary related.
These enzymes are:

 - Bacterial  16S  rRNA  dimethylase (gene ksgA), which acts in the biogenesis
   of ribosomes  by catalyzing the dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in
   the loop  of  a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of 16S rRNA. Inactivation
   of ksgA leads to resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin.
 - Yeast  18S  rRNA  dimethylase (gene DIM1), which is functionally similar to
   ksgA and that dimethylates twin adenosines in the 3'-end of 18S rRNA.
 - Bacterial 'erm' methylases. These enzymes confer  resistance  to macrolide-
   lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) antibiotics - such  as erythromycin -  by
   dimethylating the  adenine  residue  at  position  2058  of  23S  rRNA thus
   resulting in a reduced affinity between ribosomes and the MLS antibiotics.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein EO2H1.1.

The best  conserved  region  in  these  enzymes  is  located in the N-terminal
section and  corresponds  to  a region that is probably involved in S-adenosyl
methionine (SAM) binding.

* Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase active site *
******************************************************************

The major mutagenic and  carcinogenic effect of methylating agents in  DNA  is
the formation of O6-alkylguanine.  The repair  of  DNA containing O6-alkylated
guanine is carried out by the  enzyme 6-O-methylguanine-DNA  methyltransferase
(EC 2.1.1.63) (methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase) (MGMT). The
alkyl  group at the O-6 position is  transferred to a  cysteine residue in the
enzyme [1]. This is a suicide reaction: the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated
and  the  methylated protein  accumulates as a dead-end product. Most, but not
all MGMT are also  able to repair O-4-methylthymine.  MGMT sequences have been
obtained from various prokaryotic [2] and eukaryotic sources:

 - Escherichia coli and  Salmonella typhimurium inducible bifunctional protein
   ada.  The N-terminal part of the ada protein functions as a transcriptional
   activator of its own gene and of other alkylation repair genes,  while  the
   C-terminal part functions as a MGMT.
 - Bacillus subtilis adaB. In this bacteria the function of the ada complex is
   carried out by two proteins: adaA, a transcriptional activator, and adaB, a
   MGMT.
 - Escherichia coli constitutive (non-inducible) Ogt enzyme.
 - Bacillus subtilis constitutive (non-inducible) Dat1 enzyme.
 - Yeast DNA repair enzyme MGT1.
 - Mammalian MGMT protein [3].

In  all  these  enzymes  the region around the active site cysteine residue is
conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

*************************************************

N-6 adenine-specific DNA  methylases (EC 2.1.1.72) (A-Mtase) are  enzymes that
specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA.
Such enzymes are  found  in the three existing types of bacterial restriction-
modification systems  (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM
gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). All of these enzymes
recognize  a  specific  sequence  in  DNA  and  methylate  an  adenine in that
sequence.

It has been  shown [1,2,3,4] that A-Mtases contain  a conserved motif Asp/Asn-
Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal  section,  this conserved  region could be
involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity.  We have derived a
pattern from that motif.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMAC]-[LIVFYWA]-x-[DN]-P-P-[FYW]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for m.HhaII where the second Pro is  replaced  by  Gln and in m.HindIII where
 that same Pro is replaced by Tyr.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 33 different proteins that are most
 probably not A-Mtases, and three hypothetical Escherichia coli  proteins that
 could be A-Mtases.

-Note: N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases,  which are probably enzymatically
 related to A-Mtases,  also  include  a  conserved  Pro-Pro  dipeptide but the
 residues around them are  sufficiently different to allow the derivation of a
 pattern specific to these enzymes.

N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases (EC 2.1.1.113) [1,2,3]  are  enzymes that
specifically  methylate  the  amino  group at the C-4 position of cytosines in
DNA. Such enzymes are found as components of type II  restriction-modification
systems in prokaryotes.  Such enzymes recognize a specific sequence in DNA and
methylate a cytosine in that sequence.    By this action they protect DNA from
cleavage by type II restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence.

Type II N-4 Mtases seem to be  structurally  and  enzymatically related to N-6
adenine-specific DNA methylases.  Like the N-6 Mtases they contain a conserved
Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe region,  but the N- and C-terminal contexts of this region are
sufficiently different  to derive a consensus pattern specific to this type of
enzymes.

C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylases (EC 2.1.1.73) (C5 Mtase) are enzymes that
specifically methylate  the  C-5  carbon  of  cytosines  in  DNA [1,2,3]. Such
enzymes are found in the proteins described below.

 - As a component of type II  restriction-modification  systems in prokaryotes
   and some  bacteriophages.    Such enzymes recognize a specific DNA sequence
   where they  methylate  a  cytosine.  In  doing  so,  they  protect DNA from

   The sequences of a large number of type II C-5 Mtases are known.
 - In vertebrates, there  are  a  number  of  C-5 Mtases  that  methylate  CpG
   dinucleotides. The sequence of the mammalian enzyme is known.

C-5 Mtases share a number of short conserved regions. We selected two of them.
The first  is  centered  around  a  conserved  Pro-Cys  dipeptide in which the
cysteine has  been  shown  [4]  to be involved in the catalytic mechanism;  it
appears to  form a covalent intermediate with the C6 position of cytosine. The
second region is located at the C-terminal extremity in type-II enzymes.

Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase  (EC  2.1.1.77) (PCMT)
[1]  (which is also known as L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase)
is an   enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  transfer  of  a  methyl  group  from  S-
adenosylmethionine to  the free carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl or L-isoaspartyl
residues in  a  variety  of  peptides and proteins. The enzyme does not act on
normal L-aspartyl  residues  L-isoaspartyl  and D-aspartyl are the products of
the spontaneous  deamidation  and/or isomerization of normal L-aspartyl and L-
asparaginyl residues  in  proteins.  PCMT  plays  a  role in the repair and/or
degradation of  these damaged proteins; the enzymatic methyl esterification of
the abnormal  residues  can  lead  to  their  conversion  to normal L-aspartyl
residues.

PCMT is a well-conserved and widely  distributed cytosolic protein of about 24
Kd. As a signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in the central part
of this enzyme.

* Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase signatures *
***************************************************

Uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.107) (SUMT) [1,2] catalyzes the
transfer of two methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine  to the C-2 and C-7
atoms of  uroporphyrinogen  III  to  yield  precorrin-2  via  the intermediate
formation of precorrin-1. SUMT is the first enzyme specific to  the  cobalamin
pathway  and  precorrin-2 is a common  intermediate  in  the  biosynthesis  of
corrinoids such as vitamin B12, siroheme and coenzyme F430.

The sequences  of  SUMT  from  a  variety  of  eubacterial and archaebacterial
species are currently available. In species  such as Bacillus megaterium (gene
cobA), Pseudomonas  denitrificans  (cobA)  or  Methanobacterium ivanovii (gene
corA) SUMT is a protein of  about 25 to 30 Kd. In Escherichia coli and related
bacteria, the cysG protein, which is involved in the biosynthesis of siroheme,
is a  multifunctional  protein  composed  of  a  N-terminal  domain,  probably
involved in  transforming  precorrin-2  into siroheme, and a C-terminal domain
which has SUMT activity.

The sequence of SUMT is  related  to  that  of  a  number  of P. denitrificans
and Salmonella  typhimurium  enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cobalamin
which also  seem  to be SAM-dependent methyltransferases [3,4]. The similarity
is especially  strong  with two of these enzymes: cobI/cbiL which  encodes  S-
adenosyl-L-methionine--precorrin-2 methyltransferase and cobM/cbiF whose exact
function is not known.

We developed  two  signature patterns for these enzymes. The first corresponds
to a well conserved region in the N-terminal extremity (called region 1 in [1,
3]) and  the  second to a less conserved region located in the central part of
these proteins (this pattern spans what are called regions 2 and 3 in [1,3]).

* Phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase active site *
***********************************************************

Phosphoribosylglycinamide  formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) (GART) [1] catalyzes
the third step in de novo  purine biosynthesis, the transfer of a formyl group
to 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide.  In  higher  eukaryotes, GART  is  part  of a
multifunctional enzyme polypeptide that catalyzes three of the steps of purine
biosynthesis. In  bacteria, plants and yeast, GART is a monofunctional protein
of about 200 amino-acid residues.

In the Escherichia coli enzyme, an aspartic acid  residue has been shown to be
involved  in the  catalytic mechanism.   The  region  around  this active site
residue is well  conserved in GART from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources and
can be used as a signature pattern.

Mammalian formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) [2] is a cytosolic
enzyme  responsible  for  the  NADP-dependent   decarboxylative  reduction  of
10-formyltetrahydrofolate  into  tetrahydrofolate.  It  is a  protein of about
900 amino  acids  consisting  of  three  domains;  the  N-terminal domain (200
residues) is structurally related to GARTs.

Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase  (EC 2.1.2.9) (gene fmt) [3]
is the  enzyme responsible for modifying the free amino group of the aminoacyl
moiety of  methionyl-tRMA(fMet).    The  central  part  of  fmt  seems  to  be
evolutionary related to GART's active site region.

* Aspartate and ornithine carbamoyltransferases signature *
***********************************************************

Aspartate carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.2) (ATCase)  catalyzes the conversion
of aspartate and  carbamoyl  phosphate to carbamoylaspartate,  the second step
in the de  novo  biosynthesis of  pyrimidine nucleotides [1].  In  prokaryotes
ATCase  consists  of  two  subunits:  a  catalytic  chain  (gene pyrB)  and  a
regulatory chain (gene pyrI), while  in  eukaryotes it is a domain in a multi-
functional enzyme  (called URA2 in yeast,  rudimentary  in Drosophila, and CAD
in mammals [2]) that  also  catalyzes  other  steps  of  the  biosynthesis  of
pyrimidines.

Ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) (OTCase)  catalyzes the conversion
of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate  to citrulline.   In  mammals this enzyme
participates  in the    urea cycle  [3] and  is  located  in the mitochondrial
matrix.  In prokaryotes and  eukaryotic  microorganisms it  is involved in the
biosynthesis of arginine. In some bacterial species it is also involved in the
degradation of arginine [4] (the arginine deaminase pathway).

It has been  shown [5] that these two  enzymes  are evolutionary related.  The
predicted secondary structure of both enzymes are  similar  and there are some
regions   of  sequence similarities.    One  of these   regions includes three
residues which  have   been shown, by  crystallographic   studies   [6], to be
implicated   in binding the phosphoryl group   of carbamoyl phosphate. We have
selected this region as a signature for these enzymes.

* Transketolase signatures *
****************************

Transketolase  (EC 2.2.1.1) (TK)   catalyzes  the   reversible  transfer  of a
two-carbon ketol unit from xylulose 5-phosphate to an aldose receptor, such as
ribose 5-phosphate, to  form  sedoheptulose  7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate. This enzyme, together with transaldolase, provides  a  link between
the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways.

TK requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a cofactor. In most sources where TK has
been purified, it is a homodimer of approximately 70 Kd subunits. TK sequences
from a  variety  of  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  sources [1,2] show that the
enzyme has been evolutionarily conserved.

In the peroxisomes of    methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha, there is a
highly  related  enzyme, dihydroxy-acetone  synthase (DHAS) (EC 2.2.1.3) (also
known as   formaldehyde   transketolase),   which   exhibits  a  very  unusual
specificity by including formaldehyde amongst its substrates.

1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase  (DXP  synthase)  [3] is an enzyme so far
found in  bacteria  (gene  dxs)  and  plants  (gene  CLA1) which catalyzes the
thiamine pyrophosphoate-dependent acyloin condensation reaction between carbon
atoms 2  and  3 of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to yield 1-deoxy-D-
xylulose-5-phosphate (dxp),   a  precursor  in  the  biosynthetic  pathway  to
isoprenoids, thiamine  (vitamin  B1), and pyridoxol (vitamin B6). DXP synthase
is evolutionary related to TK.

We selected two regions of TK as signature patterns. The first, located in the
N-terminal section, contains a histidine residue which appears to  function in
proton transfer  during  catalysis  [4].  The second, located in  the  central
section, contains conserved acidic residues  that are part of the active cleft
and may participate in substrate-binding [4].

Transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a three-carbon
ketol unit  from  sedoheptulose  7-phosphate  to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to
form erythrose  4-phosphate  and  fructose  6-phosphate. This enzyme, together
with transketolase,  provides  a  link  between  the  glycolytic  and pentose-
phosphate pathways.  Transaldolase  is an enzyme of about 34 Kd whose sequence
has been well conserved throughout evolution. A lysine has been implicated [1]
in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme; it acts as a nucleophilic group that
attacks the carbonyl group of fructose-6-phosphate.

Transaldolase is  evolutionary  related [2] to a bacterial protein of about 20
Kd (known as talC in Escherichia coli), whose exact function is not yet known.

We developed two signature patterns for these proteins.  The first, located in
the N-terminal  section,  contains  a  perfectly  conserved  pentapeptide; the
second, includes the active site lysine.

* Acyltransferases ChoActase / COT / CPT family signatures *
************************************************************

A number of eukaryotic acetyltransferases  can  be,  on  the basis of sequence
similarities, grouped together into a family. These enzymes are:

 - Choline o-acetyltransferase  (EC 2.3.1.6)   (ChoAcTase), an   enzyme   that
   catalyzes the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [1].
 - Carnitine o-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.7) [2].
 - Peroxisomal carnitine octanoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-)  (COT), a fatty acid
   beta-oxidation pathway enzyme which is involved in the transport of medium-
   chain acyl-coenzyme A's from peroxisome to mitochondria [3].
 - Mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferases I and II (EC 2.3.1.21) (CPT),
   enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and transport [4].
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER024w.
 - Mycoplasma pneumoniae putative acetyltransferase C09_orf600.

These enzymes  share  many  regions  of  sequence  similarities.  As signature
patterns we  selected  two of these regions.  The  first one,  located  in the
N-terminal section of  these enzymes is characterized by the presence of three
[LIVM]-P dipeptides. The second region, located in the central  part  of these
enzymes is  characterized  by the conservation of a number of charged residues
including an  histidine  which  probably plays a crucial role in the catalytic
mechanism [5].

* Thiolases signatures *
************************

Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
(EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
or steroid biogenesis.

In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.

There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
condensation reaction.

Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
[4].

We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of
which are  based  on  the regions around the biologically important cysteines.
The third  is  based  on  a  highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of
these proteins.

 - Serine  acetyltransferase  (EC  2.3.1.30)  (SAT)  (gene  cysE),  an  enzyme
   involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
 - Azotobacter  chroococcum  nitrogen  fixation  protein  nifP.  NifP  is most

   enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a phosphorylated glycolipid
   that anchors the lipopolysaccharide to the outer membrane of the cell.
 - UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl]  glucosamine  N-acyltransferase  (EC  2.3.1.-)
   (gene lpxD or firA), which is also involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A.
 - Chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase (CAT) (EC 2.3.1.28)  from  Agrobacterium
   tumefaciens,  Bacillus sphaericus,  Escherichia coli  plasmid  IncFII NR79,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pIP630. These CAT are
   not evolutionary related to the main family of CAT (see <PDOC00093>).
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodL. NodL is an acetyltransferase involved in
   the O-acetylation of Nod factors.
 - Bacterial maltose O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.79).
 - Bacterial tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.117) (gene

   diaminopimelate and lysine from aspartate semialdehyde.
 - Bacterial  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate  uridyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.23)
   (gene glmU  or  gcaD  or  tms),    an  enzyme involved in peptidoglycan and

 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC18B11.09c.

These proteins have been shown [3,4] to contain a repeat structure composed of
tandem repeats  of a [LIV]-G-x(4) hexapeptide which, in the tertiary structure

Beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase   (EC  2.3.1.41)  (KAS)  [1]  is  the  enzyme  that
catalyzes the  condensation of  malonyl-ACP with the growing fatty acid chain.
It is found as a component of the following enzymatic systems:

 - Fatty acid synthetase (FAS),  which catalyzes  the formation  of long-chain
   fatty acids  from  acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA and NADPH.  Bacterial  and plant
   chloroplast FAS are composed of eight separate subunits which correspond to
   different enzymatic  activities;    beta-ketoacyl  synthase is one of these
   polypeptides. Fungal FAS consists of two multifunctional proteins, FAS1 and
   FAS2; the  beta-ketoacyl  synthase domain  is  located  in  the  C-terminal
   section of FAS2. Vertebrate FAS consists of a single multifunctional chain;
   the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain is located in the N-terminal section [2].
 - The multifunctional 6-methysalicylic acid synthase (MSAS) from  Penicillium

Chalcone synthases (CHS) (EC 2.3.1.74) and stilbene synthases (STS)  (formerly
known as  resveratrol synthases)  are  related  plant  enzymes [1].  CHS is an
important enzyme  in  flavanoid biosynthesis and STS a key enzyme in stilbene-
type phyloalexin  biosynthesis.  Both  enzymes  catalyze the addition of three
molecules of  malonyl-CoA  to  a  starter  CoA  ester  (a  typical  example is
4-coumaroyl-CoA), producing  either  a  chalcone  (with CHS) or stilbene (with
STS).

These enzymes  are  proteins  of  about  390  amino-acid residues. A conserved
cysteine residue,  located  in the central section of these proteins, has been
shown [2]  to  be  essential  for  the  catalytic activity of both enzymes and
probably represents  the binding site for the 4-coumaryl-CoA group. The region
around this  active  site  residue  is  well  conserved  and  can be used as a
signature pattern.

In addition  to the plant enzymes, this family also includes Bacillus subtilis
bcsA.

Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (EC 2.3.2.2) (GGT) [1]  catalyzes the transfer of
the gamma-glutamyl moiety  of glutathione to an  acceptor that may be an amino
acid, a peptide  or water (forming glutamate).   GGT  plays a  key role in the
gamma-glutamyl  cycle,  a  pathway  for  the  synthesis   and  degradation  of
glutathione.  In prokaryotes  and eukaryotes, it is an enzyme that consists of
two polypeptide  chains,  a heavy and a light subunit, processed from a single
chain precursor.  The  active  site of GGT is known to be located in the light
subunit.

The sequences  of  mammalian  and  bacterial  GGT  show a number of regions of

*********************************
* Transglutaminases active site *
*********************************

Transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13)  (TGase) [1,2] are  calcium-dependent  enzymes
that catalyze the cross-linking of  proteins  by  promoting  the formation  of
isopeptide bonds  between  the  gamma-carboxyl  group  of  a  glutamine in one
polypeptide chain and  the  epsilon-amino  group  of  a  lysine  in  a  second
polypeptide chain.  TGases  also  catalyze the  conjugation  of  polyamines to
proteins.

The best  known  transglutaminase  is  blood coagulation factor XIII, a plasma
tetrameric protein composed of two catalytic A subunits  and two non-catalytic
B subunits.  Factor XIII is responsible  for cross-linking fibrin chains, thus
stabilizing the fibrin clot.

Other forms of transglutaminases  are  widely  distributed  in various organs,
tissues and  body fluids.  Sequence data is available  for the following forms
of TGase:

 - Transglutaminase K (Tgase K), a  membrane-bound enzyme  found  in mammalian
   epidermis and  important  for  the formation of the cornified cell envelope
   (gene TGM1).
 - Tissue transglutaminase (TGase C), a monomeric ubiquitous enzyme located in
   the cytoplasm (gene TGM2).
 - Transglutaminase  3,  responsible  for  the  later  stages of cell envelope
   formation in the epidermis and the hair follicle (gene TGM3).
 - Transglutaminase 4 (gene TGM4).

A conserved cysteine  is  known  to  be involved in the catalytic mechanism of
TGases.

The erythrocyte membrane band 4.2 protein,  which  probably plays an important
role in  regulating the shape of erythrocytes and their mechanical properties,
is evolutionary  related  to  TGases.  However  the  active  site  cysteine is
substituted by an alanine and the 4.2 protein does not show TGase activity.

UDP glycosyltransferases (UGT) are a superfamily of enzymes that catalyzes the

molecule. This family currently consist of:

 - Mammalian  UDP-glucoronosyl    transferases  (EC 2.4.1.17) (UDPGT) [1,2]. A
   large family    of  membrane-bound  microsomal  enzymes  which catalyze the
   transfer of  glucuronic  acid to a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous
   lipophilic substrates.  These  enzymes  are  of  major  importance  in  the
   detoxification and  subsequent elimination of xenobiotics such as drugs and
   carcinogens.
 - A large number of putative UDPGT from Caenorhabditis elegans.
 - Mammalian   2-hydroxyacylsphingosine      1-beta-galactosyltransferase  [3]
   (EC 2.4.1.45) (also known as UDP-galactose-ceramide galactosyltransferase).
   This enzyme  catalyzes  the  transfer  of  galactose  to  ceramide,  a  key
   enzymatic step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  galactocerebrosides,  which  are
   abundant sphingolipids of the myelin membrane of the central nervous system
   and peripheral nervous system.
 - Plants flavonol O(3)-glucosyltransferase  (EC 2.4.1.91). An enzyme [4] that
   catalyzes the  transfer  of  glucose  from  UDP-glucose to a flavanol. This
   reaction is  essential  and  one  of  the last steps in anthocyanin pigment
   biosynthesis.
 - Plants limonoid glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.210).
 - Baculoviruses  ecdysteroid  UDP-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-) [5] (egt).
   This enzyme   catalyzes   the  transfer  of  glucose  from  UDP-glucose  to
   ectysteroids which  are  insect  molting hormones. The expression of egt in
   the insect  host  interferes with the normal insect development by blocking
   the molting process.
 - Prokaryotic  zeaxanthin  glucosyl  transferase (EC 2.4.1.-) (gene crtX), an
   enzyme involved   in   carotenoid   biosynthesis  and  that  catalyses  the
   glycosylation reaction   which   converts  zeaxanthin  to  zeaxanthin-beta-

 - Streptomyces macrolide glycosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.-) [6]. These enzymes
   specifically inactivates   macrolide  anitibiotics  via  2'-O-glycosylation
   using UDP-glucose.

These enzymes share a conserved domain of about 50 amino acid residues located
in their  C-terminal  section  and  from which a pattern has been extracted to
detect them.

* Glutamine amidotransferases class-I active site *
***************************************************

A large group of biosynthetic enzymes are able to  catalyze the removal of the
ammonia group from glutamine and then to transfer this group to a substrate to
form  a new   carbon-nitrogen  group.  This catalytic  activity  is  known  as
glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) (EC 2.4.2.-) [1]. The GATase domain exists
either as a separate  polypeptidic subunit or  as part of a larger polypeptide
fused in  different  ways  to a  synthase domain.  On  the  basis  of sequence
similarities two classes of GATase domains have been identified [2,3]: class-I
(also known as trpG-type) and  class-II  (also  known  as  purF-type). Class-I
GATase domains have been found in the following enzymes:

 - The second  component of anthranilate  synthase (AS) (EC 4.1.3.27) [4].  AS
   catalyzes the biosynthesis  of  anthranilate from chorismate and glutamine.
   AS is generally a  dimeric  enzyme:  the  first  component  can  synthesize
   anthranilate using ammonia  rather  than  glutamine,  whereas  component II
   provides the GATase  activity.   In some bacteria and in fungi  the  GATase
   component of AS is  part  of a  multifunctional protein that also catalyzes
   other steps of the biosynthesis of tryptophan.
 - The second component of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) synthase (EC 4.1.3.
   -), a dimeric  prokaryotic  enzyme  that   function  in  the  pathway  that
   catalyzes the biosynthesis of para-aminobenzoate (PABA) from chorismate and
   glutamine.  The second  component (gene pabA)  provides the GATase activity
   [4].
 - CTP synthase (EC 6.3.4.2). CTP synthase catalyzes the final reaction in the
   biosynthesis of pyrimidine, the ATP-dependent formation of CTP from UTP and
   glutamine. CTP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct
   domains; the GATase domain is in the C-terminal section [2].
 - GMP synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.2).  GMP synthase  catalyzes
   the   ATP-dependent  formation  of  GMP  from  xanthosine 5'-phosphate  and
   glutamine. GMP synthase is a single chain enzyme that contains two distinct
   domains; the GATase domain is in the N-terminal section [5].
 - Glutamine-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase  (EC 6.3.5.5) (GD-CPSase);
   an enzyme  involved in  both arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and which
   catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine
   and carbon dioxide.  In bacteria GD-CPSase is composed of two subunits: the
   large chain (gene carB) provides the CPSase activity, while the small chain
   (gene carA) provides the GATase activity.  In yeast  the enzyme involved in
   arginine biosynthesis is also composed of two subunits:  CPA1 (GATase), and
   CPA2 (CPSase).  In most eukaryotes,  the  first  three steps  of pyrimidine
   biosynthesis are  catalyzed by a large multifunctional enzyme  (called URA2
   in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila, and CAD in mammals). The GATase domain
   is located at the N-terminal extremity of this polyprotein [6].
 - Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase II (EC 6.3.5.3),  an enzyme that
   catalyzes the  fourth  step in the de novo biosynthesis of purines. In some
   species of bacteria, FGAM  synthase II is composed of two subunits: a small
   chain (gene purQ)  which  provides  the  GATase  activity and a large chain
   (gene purL) which provides the aminator activity.
 - The histidine amidotransferase hisH, an  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the fifth
   step in the biosynthesis of histidine in prokaryotes.

In the second component of AS  a  cysteine  has been shown [7] to be essential
for the amidotransferase activity.    The sequence around this residue is well
conserved in all  the  above  GATase  domains and  can  be used as a signature
pattern for class-I GATase.

   in purine biosynthesis,  the transfer  of the ammonia group of glutamine to
   PRPP to form 5-phosphoribosylamine (gene purF in bacteria, ADE4 in yeast).
 - Glucosamine--fructose-6-phosphate  aminotransferase   (EC 2.6.1.16).   This
   enzyme catalyzes a  key reaction in amino sugar synthesis, the formation of
   glucosamine 6-phosphate from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine  (gene glmS
   in Escherichia coli, nodM in Rhizobium, GFA1 in yeast)
 - Asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing) (EC 6.3.5.4).  This enzyme is
   responsible for the synthesis of asparagine from aspartate and glutamine.

A cysteine is present at the N-terminal extremity of  the  mature  form of all
these enzymes. The cysteine has been shown, in amido phosphoribosyltransferase
[4] and in  asparagine  synthetase [5] to  be  important  for   the  catalytic
mechanism.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except

-Note: the active site cysteine is found at  the N-terminus of the MATURE form
 of all these proteins, but  in  some  cases (for example in Bacillus subtilis
 or chicken amido phosphoribosyltransferase) the enzyme is synthesized  with a
 short propeptide  which  is cleaved off post-translationally; this is why  we
 indicated the  pattern as <x(0,11)-  instead of <x(0,1)- (0 for a mature form
 without the initiator Met, 1 with the initiator Met).

Thymidine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.4) catalyzes  the  reversible phosphorolysis
of thymidine, deoxyuridine and  their  analogues to their respective bases and
2-deoxyribose 1-phosphate. This enzyme regulates the availability of thymidine
and is therefore essential to nucleic acid metabolism.

In Escherichia coli (gene deoA), the  enzyme  is a dimer of identical subunits
of about  48  Kd  [1].  In  humans it was first identified as platelet-derived
endothelial cell  growth  factor (PD-ECGF) [E1] before being recognized [2] as
thymidine phosphorylase.

Bacterial pyrimidine-nucleoside  phosphorylase  (EC 2.4.2.2) (gene pdp) [3] is
an enzyme evolutionary and structurally related to thymidine phosphorylase.

As a  signature pattern for these enzymes, we selected a well conserved region
of 19 residues located in the N-terminal part of these proteins.

*************************************
* Polyprenyl synthetases signatures *
*************************************

A variety of isoprenoid compounds  are synthesized by various organisms.   For
example in eukaryotes the isoprenoid biosynthetic  pathway is  responsible for
the synthesis of a variety  of end products including  cholesterol,  dolichol,
ubiquinone or coenzyme Q.  In  bacteria this pathway leads to the synthesis of
isopentenyl tRNA, isoprenoid quinones, and sugar carrier lipids.    Among  the
enzymes  that  participate  in  that  pathway,  are  a  number  of  polyprenyl
synthetase enzymes which catalyze a 1'4-condensation between 5 carbon isoprene
units.

Currently the sequence of some of these enzymes is known:

 - Eukaryotic farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (FPP synthetase) (EC 2.5.1.1 /
   EC 2.5.1.10) which  catalyzes  the  sequential condensation  of isopentenyl
   pyrophosphate (IPP) with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), and then with
   the resultant  geranyl pyrophosphate  to form farnesyl pyrophosphate.   FPP
   synthetase is a cytoplasmic dimeric enzyme.
 - Prokaryotic farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (gene ispA).
 - Prokaryotic octaprenyl diphosphate synthase (gene ispB).
 - Prokaryotic heptaprenyl diphosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.30).
 - Eukaryotic  geranylgeranyl  pyrophosphate   synthetase   (GGPP  synthetase)
   (EC 2.5.1.1 / EC 2.5.1.10 / EC 2.5.1.29)  which  catalyzes  the  sequential
   addition of the three molecules  of  IPP  onto DMAPP to form geranylgeranyl
   pyrophosphate.  In plants GGPP synthase is a chloroplast enzyme involved in
   the biosynthesis of terpenoids; in  fungi,  such as Neurospora crassa (gene
   al-3), this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids.
 - Prokaryotic GGPP synthetase,  which  are  involved  in  the biosynthesis of
   carotenoids (gene crtE). Such  an  enzyme  is  also encoded in the cyanelle
   genome of Cyanophora paradoxa.
 - Eukaryotic hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase,  which  is involved in  the
   biosynthesis of coenzyme Q  and which catalyzes the formation of all trans-
   polyprenyl pyrophosphates generally ranging in  length of  between 6 and 10
   isoprene units depending on the species.   HP synthetase is a mitochondrial
   membrane-associated enzyme.

It has been shown [1 to 5] that  all the above enzymes share some  regions  of
sequence similarity.   Two of these regions are rich in aspartic-acid residues
and could be  involved  in the  catalytic  mechanism and/or the binding of the
substrates. We have developed signature patterns for both regions.

Possible additional members of this family of proteins are:

 - Bacillus subtilis spore germination protein C3 (gene gerC3).

We believe [6] that both  proteins  are most probably also enzymes involved in
isoprenoid metabolism.

**********************************************
* Squalene and phytoene synthases signatures *
**********************************************

Two different polyisoprene synthases have been shown [1,2,3] to share a number
of regions of sequence similarities:

 - Squalene synthase (EC 2.5.1.21)  (farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase)
   (SQS), which   catalyzes  the  conversion  of  two  molecules  of  farnesyl
   diphosphate (FPP)  into  squalene.  It  is  the first committed step in the
   cholesterol biosynthetic  pathway.  The  reaction  carried  out  by  SQS is
   catalyzed in  two  separate steps: the first is a head-to-head condensation
   of the   two  molecules  of  FPP  to  form  presqualene  diphosphate;  this
   intermediate is  then  rearranged  in  a  NADP-dependent reduction, to form
   squalene. SQS  is  found  in eukaryotes. In yeast is is encoded by the ERG9
   gene, in mammals by the FDFT1 gene. SQS seems to be membrane-bound.
 - Phytoene synthase (EC 2.5.1.-) (PSY), which catalyzes the conversion of two
   molecules of  geranylgeranyl  diphosphate  (GGPP)  into phytoene. It is the
   second step   in   the   biosynthesis   of   carotenoids  from  isopentenyl
   diphosphate.  The reaction  carried out by PSY is catalyzed in two separate
   steps: the  first  is  a  head-to-head condensation of the two molecules of
   GGPP to form prephytoene diphosphate; this  intermediate is then rearranged
   to form   phytoene.   PSY   is  found  in  all  organisms  that  synthesize
   carotenoids: plants  and  photosynthetic  bacteria  as  well  as  some non-
   photosynthetic bacteria and fungi.  In  bacteria PSY is encoded by the gene
   crtB. In plants PSY is localized in the chloroplast.

As it can be seen from the description above,  both SQS and PSY share a number
of functional  similarities  which  are  also  reflected at the level of their
primary structure.  In  particular  three well conserved regions are shared by
SQS and PSY; they could be  involved in substrate binding and/or the catalytic
mechanism.  We developed signature patterns for the second and third conserved
regions; they are localized in the central part of these enzymes.

* Protein prenyltransferases alpha subunit repeat signature *
*************************************************************

Protein prenyltransferases  catalyze  the transfer of an isoprenyl moiety to a
cysteine four  residues  from  the  C-terminus  of  several proteins. They are
heterodimeric enzymes consisting of alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit
is thought  to  participate in a stable complex with the isoprenyl  substrate;
the beta    subunit    binds   the   peptide   substrate.   Distinct   protein
prenyltransferases might  share  a  common  alpha subunit.  Both the alpha and
beta subunit  show repetitive sequence motifs [1]. These repeats have distinct
structural and  functional implications and are unrelated to each other. Known
protein prenyltransferase alpha subunits are:

 - Mammalian protein farnesyltransferase alpha subunit.
 - Yeast protein RAM2, a protein farnesyltransferase alpha subunit.
 - Yeast protein BET4, a protein geranylgeranyltransferase alpha subunit.

The conserved domain of the alpha subunit consists of about 34 amino acids and
is repeated  five times. It contains an invariant tryptophan possibly involved
in heterodimerization  with  the  conserved  phenylalanines  in  the  repeated
domains of the beta subunits, via hydrophobic bonds. The signature pattern for
this domain is centered on the invariant tryptophan.

* Riboflavin synthase alpha chain family Lum-binding site signature *
*********************************************************************

The following  proteins  have  been  shown  [1,2]    to  be  structurally  and
evolutionary related:

 - Riboflavin synthase  alpha  chain (EC 2.5.1.9)  (RS-alpha)  (gene  ribC  in
   Escherichia coli,  ribB in Bacillus subtilis and Photobacterium leiognathi,
   RIB5 in  yeast).  This enzyme synthesizes riboflavin from two moles of 6,7-
   dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine (Lum), a pteridine-derivative.
 - Photobacterium phosphoreum lumazine  protein (LumP) (gene luxL).  LumP is a
   protein that  modulates  the  color  of  the  bioluminescence  emission  of
   bacterial luciferase. In the presence of LumP, light emission is shifted to
   higher energy  values (shorter wavelength). LumP  binds  non-covalently  to
   6,7-dimethyl-8-(1'-D-ribityl)lumazine.
 - Vibrio fischeri  yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (gene luxY).  Like  LumP,
   YFP modulates  light  emission  but  towards a longer wavelength. YFP binds
   non-covalently to FMN.

These proteins seem to  have evolved from the duplication of a domain of about
100 residues.  In  its  C-terminal  section,  this domain contains a conserved
motif [KR]-V-N-[LI]-E which has been  proposed to be the binding site for Lum.
RS-alpha which  binds  two  molecules  of  Lum  has two perfect copies of this
motif, while  LumP  which binds one molecule of Lum, has a Glu instead of Lys/
Arg in the  first  position  of the second copy of the motif. Similarily, YFP,
which binds  to  one  molecule  of  FMN,  also  seems  to  have  a potentially
dysfunctional binding site by substitution of Gly for Glu in the last position
of the first copy of the motif.

Our signature pattern includes the Lum-binding motif.

* Dihydropteroate synthase signatures *
***************************************

All organisms require reduced folate cofactors  for the synthesis of a variety
of metabolites.  Most  microorganisms  must synthesize folate  de novo because
they lack the  active transport system of higher vertebrate cells which allows
these organisms to use dietary  folates.  Enzymes  that  are  involved  in the
biosynthesis of folates are therefore the target of a variety of antimicrobial
agents such as trimethoprim or sulfonamides.

Dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15) (DHPS)  catalyzes  the  condensation of
6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine  pyrophosphate to  para-aminobenzoic acid
to form 7,8-dihydropteroate.  This  is  the  second step  in  the  three steps
pathway leading from 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin  to  7,8-dihydrofolate.
DHPS  is the target  of sulfonamides which  are substrates analog that compete
with para-aminobenzoic acid.

Bacterial DHPS (gene sul or folP) [1] is a protein of  about  275 to 315 amino
acid residues  which  is  either  chromosomally  encoded  or  found on various
antibiotic resistance plasmids. In the  lower eukaryote  Pneumocystis carinii,
DHPS is the C-terminal  domain  of  a  multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme
(gene fas) [2].

We developed two signature patterns for DHPS,  the  first signature is located
in the N-terminal section of these enzymes,  while  the  second  signature  is
located in the central section.

EPSP   synthase (3-phosphoshikimate  1-carboxyvinyltransferase)  (EC 2.5.1.19)
catalyzes the sixth step  in the biosynthesis from  chorismate of the aromatic
amino acids (the shikimate pathway)  in bacteria (gene aroA), plants and fungi
(where it is part of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyzes five consecutive
steps in  this  pathway) [1]. EPSP synthase has been extensively studied as it
is the target of the potent herbicide glyphosate which inhibits the enzyme.

The sequence  of EPSP from various biological sources shows that the structure
of the  enzyme  has  been well conserved throughout evolution. We selected two
conserved regions  as  signature  patterns. The first pattern corresponds to a
region that  is  part  of  the active site and which is also important for the
resistance to  glyphosate [2]. The second pattern is located in the C-terminal
part of  the  protein  and  contains  a  conserved  lysine  which  seems to be
important for the activity of the enzyme.

phosphate group  to  a  lysine  residue.  On the basis of sequence similarity,
these various  enzymes  can  be  grouped [1,2] into subfamilies. One of these,

glucokinase [3], is  only  expressed  in  liver and  pancreatic beta-cells and
plays an important role in modulating insulin secretion;  it is a protein of a
molecular mass of about 50 Kd.   Hexokinases of types I to III, which have low
Km values for glucose,  have a  molecular mass of about 100 Kd.   Structurally
they consist of a very small N-terminal  hydrophobic  membrane-binding  domain
followed by two highly similar domains of 450 residues.   The first domain has
lost its catalytic activity and has evolved into a regulatory domain.

In yeast there  are  three  different isozymes: hexokinase PI (gene HXK1), PII
(gene HXKB), and glucokinase (gene GLK1). All three proteins  have a molecular
mass of about 50 Kd.

All these enzymes contain one  (or two in the case of types I to III isozymes)
strongly conserved region which has been shown [4] to be involved in substrate
binding. We have derived a pattern from that region.

Galactokinase  (EC 2.7.1.6) [1]  catalyzes  the  first reaction  of  galactose
metabolism,  the  conversion  of  galactose  to  galactose 1-phosphate.  There
are three well conserved regions in the sequence of eukaryotic and prokaryotic
galactokinase.  As a signature pattern we have selected the  best conserved of
these regions, which is located in the N-terminal section of galactokinase.

In yeast the GAL3 protein [2] is required for rapid induction of the galactose
system. The exact function of GAL3 is not known, but it may be involved in the
production of a true inducer or coinducer  molecule.   The sequence of GAL3 is
closely related to that of galactokinases.

Phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11)  (PFK) [1,2] is  a key  regulatory enzyme in
the glycolytic pathway.  It  catalyzes  the phosphorylation by ATP of fructose
6-phosphate  to fructose  1,6-bisphosphate.  In  bacteria PFK is a tetramer of
identical 36 Kd subunits. In mammals it is a tetramer of 80 Kd subunits.  Each
80 Kd subunit  consist of two  homologous domains  which are highly related to
the bacterial 36 Kd subunits. In Human there are three, tissue-specific, types
of PFK isozymes: PFKM (muscle),  PFKL (liver),  and PFKP (platelet).  In yeast
PFK is an octamer composed  of  four 100 Kd alpha chains (gene PFK1)  and four
100 Kd beta chains (gene PFK2);  like the  mammalian 80 Kd subunits, the yeast
100 Kd subunits are composed of two homologous domains.

As a signature pattern for PFK  we selected a region that contains three basic
residues involved in fructose-6-phosphate binding.

It has  been  shown [1,2,3] that the following carbohydrate and purine kinases
are evolutionary  related  and  can  be grouped into a single family, which is
known [1] as the 'pfkB family':

 - Fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) (gene scrK).
 - 6-phosphofructokinase isozyme 2 (EC 2.7.1.11) (phosphofructokinase-2) (gene
   pfkB). pfkB is a minor phosphofructokinase isozyme in Escherichia coli  and
   is not  evolutionary  related  to  the  major  isozyme (gene pfkA).  Plants
   6-phosphofructokinase also belong to this family.
 - Ribokinase (EC 2.7.1.15) (gene rbsK).
 - Adenosine kinase (EC 2.7.1.20) (gene ADK).
 - 2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase (EC 2.7.1.45) (gene: kdgK).

frames. This  family,  known as ROK (Repressor, ORF, Kinase) currently consist
of:

 - Xylose  operon  repressor  (gene  xylR) in Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus
   pentosus and Staphylococcus xylosus.
 - N-acetylglucosamine repressor (gene nagC) from Escherichia coli.
 - Glucokinase (EC 2.7.1.2) (gene glk) from Streptomyces coelicolor.
 - Fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) (gene scrK or frk)  from Pediococcus pentosaceus,
   Streptococcus mutans and Zymomonas mobilis.
 - Escherichia coli allokinase (EC 2.7.1.55) (gene alsK).

   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yhcI  and HI0144,  the  corresponding

 - A hypothetical protein in nagH 5'region from Clostridium perfringens.

The repressor proteins (xylR and nagC) from  this  family possess a N-terminal
region not present in the sugar kinases and which contains an helix-turn-helix
DNA-binding motif. The domain common to all  these  proteins consists of about
300 residues.  It  is  not  highly  conserved,  but  we could define a pattern
centered on a glycine-rich region in the central part of the domain.

Phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19) (PRK) [1,2] is  one  of the enzymes specific
to the Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate cycle which is the  major route by
which carbon dioxide is assimilated and reduced by autotrophic organisms.  PRK
catalyzes  the  ATP-dependent  phosphorylation  of  ribulose 5-phosphate  into
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate which is the substrate for RubisCO.

PRK's of diverse origins show different properties with respect to the size of
the protein, the subunit  structure, or the enzymatic regulation.  However  an
alignment of  the  sequences  of  PRK   from plants, algae, photosynthetic and

******************************************

Eukaryotic  protein kinases [1 to 5]  are  enzymes  that   belong  to  a  very
extensive family of  proteins which share a conserved catalytic core common to
both serine/threonine and  tyrosine protein kinases.  There  are  a  number of
conserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein kinases. We have selected
two of these regions to build signature patterns.  The  first region, which is
located in the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain, is a glycine-rich
stretch of residues in the vicinity  of a lysine residue, which has been shown
to be involved in ATP binding.   The second  region,  which is  located in the
central part of the  catalytic  domain,  contains  a  conserved  aspartic acid
residue  which is important for the catalytic activity  of  the enzyme [6]; we
have derived  two signature patterns for that region: one specific for serine/
threonine kinases  and  the  other  for  tyrosine kinases. We also developed a
profile which is based on the alignment in [1] and covers the entire catalytic
domain.

 This pattern    will    also    detect    most    bacterial    aminoglycoside
 phosphotransferases [8,9]  and  herpesviruses ganciclovir kinases [10]; which
 are proteins structurally and evolutionary related to protein kinases.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 15.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL,  except
 for three  viral  kinases.  This  profile  also  detects  receptor  guanylate
 cyclases (see   <PDOC00430>)  and  2-5A-dependent  ribonucleases.    Sequence
 similarities between  these  two  families  and the eukaryotic protein kinase
 family have been noticed before. It also detects Arabidopsis thaliana kinase-
 like protein TMKL1 which seems to have lost its catalytic activity.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 4.

-Note: if a protein  analyzed  includes the two protein kinase signatures, the
 probability of it being a protein kinase is close to 100%
-Note: eukaryotic-type protein  kinases  have  also  been found in prokaryotes
 such as Myxococcus xanthus [11] and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
-Note: the  patterns  shown  above has been updated since their publication in
 [7].
-Note: this  documentation  entry  is linked  to both signature patterns and a

Mitogen-activated protein   kinases   (MAP   kinases,  also  called  ERKs  for
extracellularly-regulated kinases)    form   a   group   of   serine/threonine
protein   kinases   (see <PDOC00100>)  that  play  important  roles  in signal
transduction  pathways  regulating  adaptative  response  to a  wide  range of
stimuli.

Almost all MAPKs possess a conserved TXY motif in which both the threonine and
tyrosine residues  are    phosphorylated  during  activation  of the enzyme by
upstream dual-specificity MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs).

However the TXY motif is not enough conserved to develop a pattern. The region
we selected for our pattern is located just after the TXY motif and contains a
F and a C residue  that are MAPK-specific. The R and E residues in  the  first
part of  our  pattern,  and  the  R,  D and K residues in the second part, are
shared by  many  additional  protein  kinases.  They have been included in the
pattern to  eliminate matches from unrelated sequences in the database, and to
"anchor" the MAPK-specific F and C residues to this region [3,4].

Casein kinase  II  (CK-2)  [1]  is  an  ubiquitous eukaryotic serine/threonine
protein kinase which is found both in the cytoplasm and the  nucleus and whose
substrates are  numerous.  It  generally  phosphorylates  Ser  or  Thr  at the
N-terminal of stretch of acidic residues (see <PDOC00006>). CK-2 exists as  an
heterotetramer composed of  two catalytic  subunits (alpha) and two regulatory
subunits (beta). In most species there are two closely related isoforms of the
catalytic subunit: alpha  and  alpha'. Some species, such as fungi and plants,
express two    forms of  regulatory subunits: beta and beta'. The beta subunit
plays a  complex  role in regulating the basal catalytic activity of the alpha
subunit. The beta subunit is a highly conserved protein of about  25  Kd  that
contains, in its central section, a cysteine-rich motif that could be involved
in binding  a  metal such as zinc [2]. We have used this region as a signature
pattern.

* Pyruvate kinase active site signature *
*****************************************

Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) (PK) [1] catalyzes the final step in glycolysis,
the conversion  of  phosphoenolpyruvate  to  pyruvate   with  the  concomitant
phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.  PK requires  both magnesium and potassium ions
for its activity.  PK is found in all  living organisms.  In vertebrates there
are four, tissues  specific, isozymes:  L (liver),  R (red cells), M1 (muscle,
heart, and brain), and M2 (early fetal tissues). In Escherichia coli there are
two isozymes: PK-I (gene pykF) and PK-II (gene pykA).  All PK isozymes seem to
be tetramers of identical subunits of about 500 amino acid residues.

As a signature pattern for PK we  selected a  conserved region that includes a
lysine residue which seems to be the acid/base  catalyst  responsible  for the
interconversion  of  pyruvate and  enolpyruvate, and a  glutamic  acid residue
implicated in the binding of the magnesium ion.

* Phosphatidylinositol 3- and 4-kinases signatures and profile *
****************************************************************

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3-kinase)  (EC 2.7.1.137)  [1] is  an enzyme
that phosphorylates  phosphoinositides on the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol
ring. The  exact  function  of  the  three  products  of  PI3-kinase - PI-3-P,
PI-3,4-P(2) and PI-3,4,5-P(3) - is not yet known, although it is proposed that
they function  as second messengers in cell signalling. Currently, three forms
of PI3-kinase are known:

 - The  mammalian  enzyme  which is a heterodimer  of a 110 Kd catalytic chain
   (p110) and  an 85  Kd  subunit  (p85)  which allows it to bind to activated
   tyrosine protein kinases.  There are at  least  two different types of p100
   subunits (alpha and beta).
 - Yeast    TOR1/DRR1  and  TOR2/DRR2 [2], PI3-kinases required for cell cycle
   activation. Both are proteins of about 280 Kd.
 - Yeast VPS34 [3], a PI3-kinase involved in vacuolar sorting and segregation.
   VPS34 is a protein of about 100 Kd.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean VPS34 homologs.

Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase    (PI4-kinase)  (EC 2.7.1.67) [4] is  an enzyme
that acts  on  phosphatidylinositol  (PI)  in the  first committed step in the
production of  the  second  messenger inositol-1,4,5,-trisphosphate. Currently
the following forms of PI4-kinases are known:

 - Human PI4-kinase alpha.
 - Yeast PIK1, a nuclear protein of 120 Kd.
 - Yeast STT4, a protein of 214 Kd.

The PI3- and PI4-kinases  share  a  well  conserved domain at their C-terminal
section; this domain  seems to be distantly related to the catalytic domain of
protein kinases  [2].  We  developed  two  signature  patterns  from  the best
conserved parts of this domain.

Four additional proteins belong to this family:

 - Mammalian FKBP-rapamycin associated protein (FRAP) [5],  which  acts as the
   target for  the  cell-cycle  arrest  and  immunosuppressive  effects of the
   FKBP12-rapamycin complex.
 - Yeast  protein  ESR1  [6] which is required for cell growth, DNA repair and
   meiotic recombination.
 - Yeast protein TEL1 which is involved in controlling telomere length.
 - Yeast  hypothetical protein YHR099w, a  distantly  related  member  of this
   family.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC22E12.16C.

A profile was also developed that spans the complete C-terminal domain.

The following enzymes have been shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related:

 - Acetate  kinase  (EC  2.7.2.1)  (acetokinase) (gene ackA) from bacteria and
   archaebacteria. This enzyme  is  involved in the interconversion of acetate

   This enzyme  is involved in the interconversion of butyrate and butyryl-CoA
   via the butyryl phosphate intermediate.  Butyrate kinase is involved in the
   acidogenic phase of fermentation.
 - Propionate kinase (EC 2.7.2,.) (gene tdcD) from Escherichia coli.

We have developed two signature  patterns for these enzymes;  the first one is
located in the N-terminal section and the second in the central section.  Both
of them are glycine-rich and could be involved in substrate or ATP-binding.

ATP:guanido phosphotransferases  are a family of structurally and functionally
related enzymes  [1,2]  that  reversibly  catalyze  the  transfer of phosphate
between ATP  and  various phosphogens. The enzymes that belongs to this family
are:

 - Creatine kinase (EC 2.7.3.2) (CK) [3,4], which  plays  an important role in
   energy  metabolism  of vertebrates. It catalyzes the reversible transfer of
   high energy  phosphate from ATP to creatine, generating phosphocreatine and
   ADP.  There are at least four different, but very closely related, forms of
   CK.  Two  of  the  CK isozymes  are cytosolic: the M (muscle) and B (brain)
   forms while the two others  are  mitochondrial.  In  sea  urchin there is a
   flagellar isozyme, which consists of the triplication of a CK-domain.
 - Glycocyamine  kinase  (EC  2.7.3.1) (guanidoacetate kinase), an enzyme that
   catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to guanidoacetate.
 - Arginine kinase (EC 2.7.3.3),  an enzyme that  catalyzes  the  transfer  of
   phosphate from ATP to arginine.
 - Taurocyamine kinase (EC 2.7.3.4), an annelid-specific enzyme that catalyzes
   the transfer of phosphate from ATP to taurocyamine.
 - Lombricine kinase (EC 2.7.3.5),  an  annelid-specific enzyme that catalyzes
   the transfer of phosphate from ATP to lombricine.
 - Smc74 [1], a cercaria-specific enzyme from Schistosoma mansoni. This enzyme
   consists of two CK-related duplicated domains. The substrate(s) specificity
   of Smc74 is not yet known.

A cysteine  residue  is implicated in the catalytic activity of these enzymes.
The region around this active site residue is highly conserved and can be used

The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar  phosphotransferase system (PTS) [1,2]
is a major carbohydrate  transport system in bacteria.   The PTS catalyzes the
phosphorylation  of  incoming   sugar   substrates   concomitant   with  their
translocation across the cell membrane.  The  general  mechanism of the PTS is
as follows: a phosphoryl group from  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)  is transferred
to Enzyme I (EI) of the PTS which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier
protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr  then  transfers  the phosphoryl group to a sugar-
specific permease complex (enzymes EII/EIII).

HPr [3 to 5] is a small cytoplasmic protein of 70  to  90 amino acid residues.
In some bacteria HPr is a domain in a larger protein that includes a EIII(Fru)
(IIA) domain and in some cases also the EI domain.    A conserved histidine in
the N-terminal section of HPr serves as  an acceptor for  the phosphoryl group
of EI.  In the central part of HPr there is a conserved serine which, in Gram-
positive bacteria only, is phosphorylated by  an ATP-dependent protein kinase;
a process which probably play a regulatory role in sugar transport.

The sequence around both phosphorylation sites are well conserved  and can  be
used as signature patterns for HPr proteins or domains.

* PTS EIIA domains phosphorylation sites signatures *
*****************************************************

The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar  phosphotransferase system (PTS) [1,2]
is a major  carbohydrate  transport system  in  bacteria.  The  PTS  catalyzes
the  phosphorylation of  incoming  sugar  substrates  concomitant  with  their
translocation across the cell membrane.    The general mechanism of the PTS is
the  following:  a  phosphoryl   group  from   phosphoenolpyruvate   (PEP)  is
transferred  to  enzyme-I  (EI)  of  PTS  which  in  turn  transfers  it  to a
phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr  then transfers  the phosphoryl
group  to  a  sugar-specific  permease   which  consists  of  at  least  three
structurally distinct  domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC) [3]  which  can  either  be
fused together  in  a  single  polypeptide chain  or  exist as  two  or  three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The first domain (IIA ,  carries  the  first permease-specific phosphorylation
site, an  histidine which is  phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The second domain
(IIB) is    phosphorylated  by phospho-IIA on a cysteinyl or histidyl residue,
depending on  the permease.  Finally, the phosphoryl group is transferred from
the IIB  domain  to  the  sugar  substrate  in  a process catalyzed by the IIC
domain; this process is coupled to the transmembrane transport of the sugar.

We have developed two signature patterns  for  the phosphorylation site of the
IIA domains.

************************************************************
* PTS EIIB domains cysteine phosphorylation site signature *
************************************************************

The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar  phosphotransferase system (PTS) [1,2]
is a major  carbohydrate  transport system  in  bacteria.  The  PTS  catalyzes
the  phosphorylation of  incoming  sugar  substrates  concomitant  with  their
translocation across the cell membrane.    The general mechanism of the PTS is
the  following:  a  phosphoryl   group  from   phosphoenolpyruvate   (PEP)  is
transferred  to  enzyme-I  (EI)  of  PTS  which  in  turn  transfers  it  to a
phosphoryl carrier protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr  then transfers  the phosphoryl
group  to  a  sugar-specific  permease   which  consists  of  at  least  three
structurally distinct  domains (IIA, IIB, and IIC) [3]  which  can  either  be
fused together  in  a  single  polypeptide chain  or  exist as  two  or  three
interactive chains, formerly called enzymes II (EII) and III (EIII).

The first domain (IIA)   carries  the  first  permease-specific phoshorylation
site, a  histidine, which is  phosphorylated by phospho-HPr. The second domain
(IIB) is    phosphorylated  by phospho-IIA on a cysteinyl or histidyl residue,
depending on  the permease.  Finally, the phosphoryl group is transferred from
the IIB  domain  to  the  sugar  substrate  in  a process catalyzed by the IIC
domain; this process is coupled to the transmembrane transport of the sugar.

The region  around  the phosphorylated cysteine of some PTS components is well
conserved and  can  be  used  [4] as a signature pattern for the following IIB
domains:

 - Arbutin-, cellobiose- and salicin-specific; IIB(Asc).
 - Beta-glucosides-specific; IIB(Bgl).
 - Glucose-specific; IIB(Glc).
 - N-acetylglucosamine-specific; IIB(Nag).
 - Sucrose-specific; IIB(Scr).

* Adenylate kinase signature *
******************************

Adenylate kinase  (EC 2.7.4.3) (AK) [1]  is  a  small  monomeric  enzyme  that
catalyzes the reversible transfer of MgATP to AMP (MgATP + AMP = MgADP + ADP).
In mammals there are three different isozymes:

 - AK1 (or myokinase), which is cytosolic.
 - AK2, which is located in the outer compartment of mitochondria.
 - AK3 (or GTP:AMP phosphotransferase),  which is located in the mitochondrial
   matrix and which uses MgGTP instead of MgATP.

The sequence of  AK has also  been  obtained from different  bacterial species
and from plants and fungi.

Two other enzymes have been found to be evolutionary related to AK. These are:

 - Yeast uridylate kinase  (EC 2.7.4.-) (UK)  (gene URA6) [2]  which catalyzes
   the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to UMP to form UDP and ADP.
 - Slime mold UMP-CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14) [3] which catalyzes the transfer of
   a phosphate group from ATP to either CMP or UMP to form CDP or UDP and ADP.

Several regions of  AK  family enzymes  are well conserved, including the ATP-
binding domains.  We have  selected the  most conserved  of  all  regions as a
signature for this type  of  enzyme.   This  region includes  an aspartic acid
residue that is  part of the  catalytic  cleft  of  the  enzyme  and  that  is
involved in  a salt  bridge.    It  also  includes an  arginine  residue whose
modification leads to inactivation of the enzyme.

* Nucleoside diphosphate kinases active site *
**********************************************

Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (EC 2.7.4.6) (NDK) [1] are enzymes required for
the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP)  other than ATP.  They provide
NTPs for   nucleic   acid   synthesis,   CTP  for  lipid  synthesis,  UTP  for
polysaccharide synthesis  and  GTP for protein elongation, signal transduction
and microtubule polymerization.

In eukaryotes, there seems to be a small family  of NDK isozymes each of which
acts in  a  different subcellular compartment and/or has a distinct biological
function. Eukaryotic NDK isozymes are hexamers of two highly related chains (A
and B)  [2].    By  random association (A6, A5B...AB5, B6), these two kinds of
chain form isoenzymes differing in their isoelectric point.

NDK are  proteins  of  17  Kd  that  act  via a ping-pong mechanism in which a
histidine residue  is  phosphorylated, by transfer  of  the terminal phosphate
group from  ATP.  In the presence of magnesium, the phosphoenzyme can transfer
its phosphate group to any NDP, to produce an NTP.

NDK isozymes have been  sequenced from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.  It
has also been shown [3] that the Drosophila awd (abnormal wing discs) protein,
is a  microtubule-associated NDK.  Mammalian NDK  is also  known as metastasis
inhibition factor nm23.

The sequence of NDK has been highly  conserved through evolution.  There  is a
single histidine  residue  conserved  in  all  known  NDK  isozymes,  which is
involved in  the  catalytic mechanism [2]. Our signature pattern contains this
residue.

* Guanylate kinase signature and profile *
******************************************

Guanylate  kinase   (EC 2.7.4.8)   (GK)  [1]   catalyzes   the   ATP-dependent
phosphorylation of  GMP  into  GDP.  It  is  essential  for  recycling GMP and
indirectly, cGMP.  In prokaryotes (such as Escherichia coli), lower eukaryotes
(such as    yeast)  and  in  vertebrates,  GK  is a highly conserved monomeric
protein of about 200 amino acids. GK has been shown [2,3,4] to be structurally
similar to the following proteins:

 - Protein  A57R  (or  SalG2R)  from various  strains  of Vaccinia virus. This
   protein is  highly similar to GK, but contains a frameshift mutation in the
   N-terminal section and could therefore be inactive in that virus.

The following  proteins are characterized by the presence in their sequence of
one or more copies of the DHR domain, a SH3 domain (see <PDOC50002> as well as
a C-terminal  GK-like  domain,  these  protein are collectively termed  MAGUKs
(membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologs) [5]:

 - Drosophila  lethal(1)discs  large-1  tumor  suppressor protein (gene dlg1).
   This protein  is  associated with septate junctions in developing flies and
   defects in the dlg1 gene cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal disks.
 - Mammalian tight junction protein Zo-1.
 - A  family  of  mammalian  synaptic  proteins that seem to interact with the
   cytoplasmic tail  of NMDA receptor subunits. This familly currently consist
   of SAP90/PSD-95, CHAPSYN-110/PSD-93, SAP97/DLG1 and SAP102.
 - Vertebrate 55 Kd erythrocyte membrane protein (p55). p55 is a palmitoylated,
   membrane-associated protein of unknown function.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  protein lin-2, which may play a structural role in
   the induction of the vulva.
 - Rat protein CASK.
 - Human protein DLG2.
 - Human protein DLG3.

There is  an  ATP-binding  site (P-loop) in the N-terminal section of GK. This
region is not conserved in the  GK-like domain of the above proteins which are
therefore unlikely  to  be kinases. However these proteins retain the residues
known, in  GK, to be involved in the binding of GMP. As a signature pattern we
selected a highly conserved region  that  contains two arginine and a tyrosine
which are involved in GMP-binding.

All organisms require reduced folate cofactors  for the synthesis of a variety

they lack the  active transport system of higher vertebrate cells which allows
these organisms   to   use   dietary   folates.  Enzymes  involved  in  folate
biosynthesis are therefore targets for a variety of antimicrobial agents  such
as trimethoprim or sulfonamides.

7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin-pyrophosphokinase     (EC 2.7.6.3)    (HPPK)
catalyzes the attachment of pyrophosphate to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin

Bacterial HPPK (gene folK or sulD) [1] is a  protein  of      160 to 270 amino

conserved heptapeptide [3].  The number of  repeats  varies  according  to the
species  (for example: 17 in Plasmodium, 26 in yeast, 44 in Drosophila, and 52
in mammals). The region containing  these repeats is essential to the function
of polymerase II. This  repeated heptapeptide  (called CT7n or CTD) is rich in
hydroxyl groups. It probably projects out of the globular catalytic domain and
may interact with the acidic  activator  domains of transcriptional regulatory
proteins. It is also known to bind by intercalation to DNA.  RNA polymerase II
is activated by phosphorylation. The serine and threonine residues in the CT7n
repeats are the target of such phosphorylation.

DNA-dependent RNA  polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6) are  ubiquitous enzymes  necessary
for the  transcription  of  genomic  DNA  into  RNA.  Most RNA polymerases are
multimeric enzymes and are composed of a variable number of subunits.  However
the two  largest  subunits  (generally  known  as  alpha  and beta chains) are
present in all known multimeric RNA polymerases.  The  beta chain is currently
known in:

 - Eubacterial RNA polymerase beta chain (gene rpoB).
 - Plants and algal chloroplast RNA polymerase beta chain (gene rpoB).
 - Eukaryotes RNA polymerases I, II and III second largest subunits.
 - Archebacterial RNA polymerase subunit B (gene rpoB) or B' (gene rpoB1).
 - Poxviruses RNA polymerase 132 Kd subunit (gene RPO132).
 - Baculoviruses RNA polymerase subunit LEF-8.
 - African swine fever virus RNA polymerase subunit EP1242L.
 - Fungal plasmid-encoded RNA polymerases.

The beta  chains are proteins of from 900 to 1400 amino acid residues.  A well
conserved region of 13  residues that contains two conserved lysines and which
is thought to be part of the  active site is located in the C-terminal part of
all beta chains [1]. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

In eukaryotes,   there   are   three  different  forms  of  DNA-dependent  RNA
polymerases (EC 2.7.7.6)  transcribing different sets of genes.  Each class of
RNA polymerase  is  an assemblage of ten to twelve different polypeptides.  In
archaebacteria, there  is generally a single form of RNA polymerase which also
consist of an oligomeric assemblage of 10 to 13 polypeptides.

Archaebacterial subunit H (gene rpoH) [1,2] is a small protein of about 8.5 to
10 Kd,  it is evolutionary related to the C-terminal part of a 23 Kd component
shared by  all  three  forms of eukaryotic RNA polymerases (gene RPB5 in yeast
and POLR2E in mammals).

As a signature pattern we selected a conserved  region which is located at the
N-terminal extremity  of  subunit  H; this region contains two histidines that
could play a role in the binding of a metal ion.

protein as a primer for the de novo synthesis of a DNA chain.  On the basis of
sequence similarities  a number of DNA polymerases have  been grouped together
[1,2,3] under the designation of DNA polymerase family A. The polymerases that
belong to this family are listed below.

 - Escherichia coli and various other bacterial polymerase I (gene polA).
 - Thermus aquaticus Taq polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage sp01 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage sp02 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage T5 polymerase.
 - Bacteriophage T7 polymerase.
 - Mycobacteriophage L5 polymerase.
 - Yeast mitochondrial polymerase gamma (gene MIP1).

Five regions of similarity  are  found  in  all the above polymerases.  One of
these conserved regions, known as 'motif B' [1], is located in a domain which,
in Escherichia coli polA,  has been shown to bind deoxynucleotide triphosphate
substrates; it contains a conserved tyrosine  which  has been shown, by photo-
affinity labelling, to be in the active site; a conserved lysine, also part of
this motif, can be chemically labelled, using pyridoxal phosphate. We use this
conserved region as a signature for this family of DNA polymerases.

* DNA polymerase family X signature *
*************************************

DNA polymerases (EC  2.7.7.7) can  be  classified,  on  the  basis of sequence
similarity [1],  into  at  least  four  different  groups:  A, B, C and X. DNA
polymerases that belong to family X are listed below [2]:

 - Vertebrate polymerase beta, involved in DNA repair.
 - Yeast polymerase IV (POL4) [3], an  enzyme with similar characteristics  to
   that of the mammalian polymerase beta.
 - Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase   (TdT)  (EC 2.7.7.31).  TdT catalyzes
   the elongation of polydeoxynucleotide chains by terminal addition.   One of
   the functions of this enzyme is the addition of nucleotides at the junction
   of rearranged Ig heavy chain and T cell receptor gene segments during the
   maturation of B and T cells.
 - African Swine Fever virus protein O174L [4].
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC2F7.06c.

These enzymes  are  small  (about  40  Kd) compared with other polymerases and
their reaction    mechanism  operates  via  a  distributive  mode,  i.e.  they
dissociate from the template-primer after addition of each nucleotide.

As a  signature  pattern  for  this  family  of DNA polymerases, we selected a
highly conserved  region  that contains a conserved arginine and two conserved
aspartic acid  residues. The latter together with the arginine have been shown
[5] to be involved in primer binding in polymerase beta.

Galactose-1-phosphate  uridyl  transferase (EC 2.7.7.10) (galT)  catalyzes the
transfer of an uridyldiphosphate group on  galactose (or glucose) 1-phosphate.
During the  reaction,  the  uridyl moiety links to a histidine residue. In the
Escherichia coli  enzyme,  it  has  been shown [1] that two histidine residues
separated by  a single proline residue are essential for enzyme activity.

On the  basis of sequence similarities, two apparently unrelated families seem
to exist.  Class-I  enzymes  are  found in eukaryotes as well as some bacteria
such as Escherichia coli or Streptomyces lividans, while class-II enzymes have
been found  so far only in bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis or Lactobacillus
helveticus [2].

We developed  signature  patterns for both  families.  For class-I enzymes the
signature is  based on the active site residues. For class-II enzymes we chose
a region which also includes two conserved histidines.

ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase (glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase) [1,2]
(EC 2.7.7.27)  catalyzes  a  very  important  step   in  the  biosynthesis  of
alpha 1,4-glucans  (glycogen  or  starch) in bacteria and plants: synthesis of
the activated glucosyl donor, ADP-glucose, from glucose-1-phosphate and ATP.

ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a tetrameric allosterically regulated enzyme.
It is a homotetramer in bacteria while in plant  chloroplasts and amyloplasts,
it is a heterotetramer of two different, yet evolutionary related, subunits.

There are a number of  conserved  regions in  the  sequence  of  bacterial and
plant ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase  subunits.  We  selected  three  of these
regions as  signature  patterns.  The  first  two are N-terminal and have been
proposed to  be  part  of the allosteric and/or substrate-binding sites in the
Escherichia coli  enzyme  (gene  glgC).  The  third  pattern  corresponds to a
conserved region in the central part of the enzymes.

* 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases signatures and profile *
***********************************************************

2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases [1] constitute a family of interferon-induced
enzymes that bind double-stranded  RNA (dsRNA) and  polymerizes ATP into 2'-5'
linked oligomers of adenosine (pppA(2'p5'A)n) (2-5A) of various lengths.   The
2-5A molecules activate a  latent  ribonuclease (Rnase L)  that  then  cleaves
single-stranded  RNAs; as  a result  protein  synthesis  and  virus growth are
inhibited.  Thus 2-5A synthetases  play  an  important  role  in the antiviral
action of interferons.

Three distinct classes of 2-5A synthetases have been described that correspond
to proteins of 40-46 Kd, 69-71 Kd, and 100 Kd.  The  40  and  46 Kd forms  are
produced by alternative splicing of the same gene. The 69  and 71 Kd forms are
also produced by alternative  splicing of a gene and  consist  of two adjacent
homologous domains whose sequences are  highly similar to that of the 40/46 Kd
forms. The sequence of the 100 Kd form is not yet known.

We  developed  two  signature patterns for these enzymes.   The  first spans a
region rich in glycine  residues which has been proposed [2] to be part of the
ATP-binding site.  The  second  signature  corresponds  to  a highly conserved
region located in the C-terminal part of 2-5A synthetases proteins or domains.

* MraY family signatures *

Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase (EC  2.7.8.13) (mraY) [1] is
a bacterial  enzyme  responsible    for    the    formation of the first lipid
intermediate of  the  cell  wall  peptidoglycan  synthesis.  It  catalyzes the
formation of   undecaprenyl-pyrophosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide  from
UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and undecaprenyl-phosphate. 

It is an integral membrane protein with probably ten transmembrane domains. It
belongs to family 4 of glycosyl transferases. Homologs of mraY have been found
in  the archaebacteria Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and in Arabidopsis
thaliana. 

We developed two patterns for this family of enzyme.  The first one is located
at the  end  of  the  first  cytoplasmic  loop and the beginning of the second
transmembrane domain.  The  second pattern is located in the third cytoplasmic
loop.

* PEP-utilizing enzymes signatures *
************************************

A number of enzymes that catalyze  the  transfer  of  a  phosphoryl group from
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via a phospho-histidine intermediate have been shown
to be structurally related [1,2,3,4]. These enzymes are:

 - Pyruvate,orthophosphate  dikinase (EC 2.7.9.1)  (PPDK).  PPDK catalyzes the
   reversible phosphorylation  of  pyruvate  and  phosphate  by ATP to PEP and
   diphosphate. In  plants PPDK function  in the direction of the formation of
   PEP, which is the primary acceptor of carbon dioxide in C4 and crassulacean
   acid metabolism plants.  In  some  bacteria, such as Bacteroides symbiosus,
   PPDK functions in the direction of ATP synthesis.
 - Phosphoenolpyruvate  synthase (EC 2.7.9.2) (pyruvate,water dikinase).  This
   enzyme catalyzes the reversible  phosphorylation of pyruvate by ATP to form
   PEP, AMP and phosphate, an essential step in gluconeogenesis when  pyruvate
   and lactate are used as a carbon source.
 - Phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.3.9).  This  is  the
   first enzyme of  the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase
   system (PTS),  a  major carbohydrate transport system in bacteria.  The PTS
   catalyzes  the  phosphorylation of  incoming sugar  substrates  concomitant
   with their translocation across the cell membrane.  The  general  mechanism
   of the PTS is the following:  a phosphoryl  group from PEP  is  transferred
   to enzyme-I (EI) of PTS  which in turn transfers it to a phosphoryl carrier
   protein (HPr).  Phospho-HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to a sugar-
   specific permease.

All these enzymes share  the  same  catalytic  mechanism:  they  bind  PEP and
transfer the phosphoryl  group  from it  to a histidine residue.  The sequence
around that residue is highly conserved and can be used as a signature pattern
for  these enzymes.  As  a  second  signature  pattern we selected a conserved
region in the C-terminal part  of  the  PEP-utilizing enzymes.  The biological
significance of this region is not yet known.

* Rhodanese signatures *
************************

Rhodanese  (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase)  (EC 2.8.1.1)  [1,2]  is  an enzyme
which catalyzes the transfer of the sulfane atom of thiosulfate to cyanide, to
form sulfite and thiocyanate.  In vertebrates,  rhodanese  is  a mitochondrial
enzyme of  about  300  amino-acid  residues  involved  in  forming iron-sulfur
complexes and  cyanide  detoxification.  A  cysteine residue takes part in the
catalytic mechanism.

Some bacterial  proteins  closely  related  to  rhodanese  are also thought to
express a sulfotransferase activity. These are:

 - Azotobacter vinelandii rhdA.
 - Escherichia coli sseA [3].
 - Saccharopolyspora erythraea cysA [4].
 - Synechococcus  strain  PCC  7942  rhdA  [5].  RhdA is a periplasmic protein
   probably involved in the transport of sulfur compounds.

We developed  two  patterns for the rhodanese family. They are based on highly
conserved regions, one which is located in the N-terminal region, the other at
the C-terminal extremity of the enzyme.

* Coenzyme A transferases signatures *
**************************************

Coenzyme A  (CoA)  transferases are enzymes catalyzing the reversible transfer
of CoA from one carboxylic acid to another.  They have been identified in many
prokaryotes and in mammalian tissues. They belong to an evolutionary conserved
[1,2] family of proteins that consist of:

 - Succinyl  CoA:3-oxoacid  CoA  transferase  (EC  2.8.3.5)  (SCOT),  which is
   responsible for  the  formation  of  acetoacetyl  CoA  by transfer of a CoA
   moiety from  succinyl-CoA  to a 3-oxoacid, usually acetoacetate.  In higher
   eukaryotes it  is  a  mitochondrial  enzyme  which  plays a crucial role in
   ketone body metabolism. It has also been found in bacteria.
 - Bacterial beta-ketoadipate CoA-transferase  (EC 2.8.3.6) which  carries out
   the penultimate step in the conversion of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to
   tricarboxylic acid  cycle  intermediates  in  bacteria  utilizing the beta-
   ketoadipate pathway.
 - Bacterial acetate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.8).
 - Clostridial  butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.9), which acts
   mainly to detoxify the medium by removing the acetate and butyrate excreted
   earlier in the fermentation.

The bacterial enzymes are heterodimer of two subunits (A and B) of about 25 Kd
each while  eukaryotic  SCOT  consist of a single chain which is colinear with
the two bacterial subunits.

We developed  two  signature patterns for these enzymes. The first corresponds
to a region in  the N-terminal of  the A subunit that may be implicated in the
binding of  CoA  to  the  enzyme. The second corresponds to a region in the N-
terminal of  the  B  subunit  and contains a glutamate that is involved in the
catalytic mechanism [3].

********************************************

Phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) (PA2) [1,2] is  an  enzyme  which releases fatty
acids  from  the  second  carbon group of glycerol.  PA2's are small and rigid
proteins of  120  amino-acid residues that have four to seven disulfide bonds.
PA2 binds a calcium ion which is required for activity. The side chains of two
conserved residues,  a  histidine  and  an  aspartic  acid,  participate  in a
'catalytic network'.

Many PA2's  have been sequenced from snakes, lizards, bees and mammals. In the
latter, there are at least four forms: pancreatic, membrane-associated as well
as two less characterized forms. The venom of most  snakes  contains  multiple
forms of   PA2.  Some  of  them  are  presynaptic  neurotoxins  which  inhibit
neuromuscular transmission  by  blocking  acetylcholine release from the nerve
termini.

We derived  two  different signature patterns for PA2's. The first is centered
on the  active  site  histidine  and  contains  three  cysteines  involved  in
disulfide bonds.  The  second is centered on the active site aspartic acid and
also contains three cysteines involved in disulfide bonds.

* Lipases, serine active site *
*******************************

Triglyceride lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) [1]  are  lipolytic  enzymes that hydrolyzes
the ester  bond of  triglycerides.  Lipases are widely distributed in animals,
plants and prokaryotes. In higher vertebrates there are at least three tissue-
specific isozymes: pancreatic, hepatic, and gastric/lingual. These three types
of lipases are  closely related to each other as well as to lipoprotein lipase
(EC 3.1.1.34) [2], which hydrolyzes triglycerides of chylomicrons and very low
density lipoproteins (VLDL).

The most conserved region  in  all  these proteins is centered around a serine
residue  which  has  been shown [3] to participate, with an  histidine  and an
aspartic acid residue, to a charge relay system. Such a region is also present
in lipases of prokaryotic origin  and in lecithin-cholesterol  acyltransferase
(EC 2.3.1.43)  (LCAT)  [4],  which   catalyzes  fatty  acid  transfer  between
phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. We have built a pattern from that region.

The following lipolytic enzymes are evolutionary related [1]:

 - Mammalian  hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). In adipose tissue and heart, HSL

***************************************
* Carboxylesterases type-B signatures *
***************************************

Higher eukaryotes  have many distinct esterases. Among the different types are
those which  act  on  carboxylic esters (EC 3.1.1.-). Carboxyl-esterases  have
been classified   into  three  categories  (A,  B  and  C)  on  the  basis  of
differential patterns  of  inhibition  by  organophosphates. The sequence of a
number of  type-B  carboxylesterases  indicates  [1,2,3] that the majority are
evolutionary related.   This   family  currently  consists  of  the  following
proteins:

 - Acetylcholinesterase   (EC   3.1.1.7)  (AChE)  from  vertebrates  and  from
   Drosophila.
 - Mammalian cholinesterase II (butyryl cholinesterase) (EC 3.1.1.8).
   Acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase II are closely related enzymes that
   hydrolyze choline esters [4].
 - Mammalian liver microsomal carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1).
 - Drosophila  esterase  6,  produced  in the anterior ejaculatory duct of the
   male insect  reproductive  system  where it plays an important  role in its
   reproductive biology.
 - Drosophila esterase P.
 - Culex pipiens (mosquito) esterases B1 and B2.
 - Myzus persicae (peach-potato aphid) esterases E4 and FE4.
 - Mammalian bile-salt-activated  lipase (BAL) [5], a  multifunctional  lipase
   which catalyzes fat and vitamin absorption. It  is  activated by bile salts
   in infant intestine where it helps to digest milk fats.
 - Insect juvenile hormone esterase (JH esterase) (EC 3.1.1.59).
 - Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) from the fungi Geotrichum candidum and Candida rugosa.
 - Caenorhabditis gut esterase (gene ges-1).
 - Duck  fatty  acyl-CoA hydrolase, medium chain (EC 3.1.2.14), an enzyme that
   may be  associated with peroxisome proliferation and may play a role in the
   production of 3-hydroxy fatty acid diester pheromones.
 - Membrane enclosed crystal  proteins from slime mold.  These  proteins  are,
   most probably  esterases;  the vesicles where they are found have therefore
   been termed esterosomes.

So far two bacterial proteins have been found to belong to this family:

 - Phenmedipham hydrolase (phenylcarbamate hydrolase), an Arthrobacter oxidans
   plasmid-encoded enzyme   (gene   pcd)  that  degrades  the  phenylcarbamate
   herbicides phenmedipham   and  desmedipham  by  hydrolyzing  their  central
   carbamate linkages.
 - Para-nitrobenzyl esterase from Bacillus subtilis (gene pnbA).

The following proteins, while having lost their catalytic activity,  contain a
domain evolutionary related to that of carboxylesterases type-B:

 - Thyroglobulin (TG), a glycoprotein specific to the thyroid gland,  which is
   the precursor of the iodinated thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4)  and triiodo
   thyronine (T3).
 - Drosophila protein neuractin (gene nrt) which  may mediate or modulate cell
   adhesion between embryonic cells during development.
 - Drosophila protein glutactin (gene glt), whose function is not known.

As is  the  case  for lipases and serine proteases, the catalytic apparatus of
esterases involves three residues (catalytic triad): a serine, a glutamate  or
aspartate and  a histidine. The sequence around the active site serine is well
conserved and  can  be  used  as  a  signature  pattern. As a second signature
pattern, we selected a  conserved region located in the N-terminal section and
which contains a cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

* Pectinesterase signatures *
*****************************

Pectinesterase (EC 3.1.1.11) (pectin methylesterase)  catalyzes the hydrolysis
of pectin into pectate and methanol.  In plants, it plays an important role in
cell wall metabolism during fruit ripening. In plant  bacterial pathogens such
as Erwinia  carotovora  and  in  fungal  pathogens  such as Aspergillus niger,
pectinesterase is involved in maceration and soft-rotting of plant tissue.

Prokaryotic and  eukaryotic  pectinesterases  share  a few regions of sequence
similarity [1,2,3].  We  selected  two of these regions as signature patterns.
The first is based on a region in the N-terminal section of these enzymes;  it
contains a conserved tyrosine which may play a role in the catalytic mechanism
[3]. The  second  pattern  corresponds  to  the  best  conserved    region, an
octapeptide located in the central part of these enzymes.

Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.29) (PTH) is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves
peptidyl-tRNA or N-acyl-aminoacyl-tRNA to yield free peptides  or N-acyl-amino
acids and  tRNA.  The  natural  substrate for this enzyme may be peptidyl-tRNA
which drop off the ribosome during protein synthesis [1,2].  Bacterial PTH has
been found [2,3] to  be  evolutionary  related  to  yeast hypothetical protein
YHR189w.

PTH and  YHR189w  are  proteins of about 200 amino acid residues. As signature
patterns, we  selected  two  conserved regions that each contain an histidine.
The first  of these regions is located in the N-terminal section, the other in
the central part.

4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase (EC 3.1.2.23) is an enzyme from  Pseudomonas
CBS-3, a  soil-dwelling  microbe that survives on 4-chlorobenzoate as its sole
carbon source.  This enzyme [1] catalyzes  the  last of the three steps in the
pathway from   4-chlorobenzoate   to  hydroxybenzoate,  the  cleavage  of  the
thioester bond of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA to form hydroxybenzoate.

4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase is a protein of 141 amino-acid residues that
assemble as  an homotetramer. An aspartate in the N-terminal domain is thought
to participate in the catalytic mechanism.

This enzyme is evolutionary related to a number of uncharacterized proteins:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybgC.
 - Aquifex aeolicus hypothetical protein AQ_1494.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0386.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0496.

* Alkaline phosphatase active site *
************************************

Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) (ALP) [1] is a zinc and magnesium-containing
metalloenzyme  which hydrolyzes phosphate esters, optimally at high pH.  It is
found in nearly  all living organisms,  with the exception of some plants.  In
Escherichia coli, ALP (gene phoA) is found in the periplasmic space.  In yeast
it (gene  PHO8)  is  found  in  lysosome-like vacuoles and in mammals, it is a
glycoprotein attached to the membrane by a GPI-anchor.

In mammals, four different isozymes are currently known [2]. Three of them are
tissue-specific:  the  placental,  placental-like (germ cell)   and intestinal
isozymes.  The fourth form is  tissue non-specific and was previously known as
the liver/bone/kidney isozyme.

Streptomyces' species  involved  in  the  synthesis  of  streptomycin (SM), an
antibiotic, express  a  phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.39) (gene strK) which is  highly
related to ALP.   It specifically cleaves  both  streptomycin-6-phosphate and,
more slowly, streptomycin-3"-phosphate.

A serine is involved   in the catalytic activity of ALP. The region around the
active site serine is relatively well conserved and can be used as a signature
pattern.

* Histidine acid phosphatases signatures *
******************************************

Acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.2)  are  a  heterogeneous group  of  proteins that
hydrolyze phosphate esters, optimally at low pH.  It has been shown [1] that a
number of acid phosphatases, from both  prokaryotes and eukaryotes,  share two
regions of  sequence  similarity,  each  centered around a conserved histidine
residue. These  two  histidines  seem to be involved in the enzymes' catalytic
mechanism [2,3].  The first histidine is located in the N-terminal section and
forms a  phosphohistidine  intermediate  while the second is located in the C-
terminal section  and possibly acts as proton donor. Enzymes belonging to this
family are called 'histidine acid phosphatases' and are listed below:

 - Escherichia coli pH 2.5 acid phosphatase (gene appA).
 - Escherichia coli glucose-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.10) (gene agp).
 - Yeast constitutive and repressible acid phosphatases (genes PHO3 and PHO5).

* 5'-nucleotidase signatures *
******************************

5'-nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) [1]  are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of
phosphate  esterified at carbon 5' of  the ribose  and deoxyribose portions of
nucleotide molecules.  5'-nucleotidase  is a ubiquitous enzyme found in a wide
variety of  species  and  which  occurs  in  different cellular locations. The
sequences of the following 5'-nucleotidases are currently known:

 - Extracellular 5'-nucleotidase from mammals and electric ray.  This  isozyme
   is a homodimeric disulfide-bonded glycoprotein attached to the  membrane by
   a GPI-anchor. It requires zinc for its activity
 - Vibrio parahaemolyticus 5'-nucleotidase (gene nutA).  This isozyme is bound
   to the membrane by a lipid chain.  NutA  requires  chloride  and magnesium
   ions for   its  activity.  It  is    involved  in  degrading  extracellular
   5'-nucleotides for nutritional needs.
 - Periplasmic bacterial 5'-nucleotidase (gene ushA).  This enzyme, also known
   as UDP-sugar hydrolase (EC 3.6.1.45), can  degrade  UDP-glucose and   other
   nucleotide diphosphate  sugars.  It  produces  sugar-1-phosphate  which can
   then be used by the cell. UshA seems to require cobalt for its activity.

5'-nucleotidases are evolutionary related to the following enzyme:

 - Periplasmic bacterial 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.
   4.16) (gene cpdB).  This  bifunctional  enzyme  catalyzes  two  consecutive
   reactions: it  first converts 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide  to 3'-nucleotide and
   then acts as a 3'-nucleotidase.
 - Mosquito  apyrase  (EC  3.6.1.5)  (ATP-diphosphohydrolase) [2]. This enzyme
   catalyzes the  hydrolysis  of  ATP  into AMP and facilitates hematophagy by
   preventing ADP-dependent platelet aggregation in the host.

All these  proteins share a number of regions of sequence similarity, of which
we selected  two  as  signature  patterns.  Both regions are located in the N-
terminal section  of  these  enzymes.  The second pattern contains a perfectly
conserved pentapeptide.

fructose 6-phosphate.  It is involved in many different metabolic pathways and

Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.37) (SBPase) [2] is an enzyme found

* Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases signature *
************************************************************

Serine/threonine specific protein phosphatases  (EC 3.1.3.16) (PP) [1,2,3] are
enzymes that catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a serine or
a threonine  residue.  They  are  very  important in controlling intracellular
events in  eukaryotic  cells.  In mammalian tissues four different types of PP
have been  identified  and  are  known as PP1, PP2A, PP2B and PP2C. Except for
PP2C, these enzymes are evolutionary related.

 - Protein  phosphatase-1  (PP1)  is  an  enzyme  of broad specificity.  It is
   inhibited by  two  thermostable  proteins,  inhibitor-1 and -2. In mammals,
   there are  two  closely  related  isoforms of PP-1: PP-1alpha and PP-1beta,
   produced by  alternative splicing of the same gene. In Emericella nidulans,
   PP-1 (gene  bimG)  plays  an important role in mitosis control by reversing
   the action  of  the  nimA kinase. In yeast, PP-1 (gene SIT4) is involved in
   dephosphorylating the large subunit of RNA polymerase II.
 - Protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) is also an enzyme of broad specificity.  PP2A
   is a trimeric enzyme that consist of a core composed of a catalytic subunit
   associated with a 65 Kd regulatory subunit and a third variable subunit. In
   mammals, there are two closely  related isoforms  of  the catalytic subunit
   of PP2A: PP2A-alpha and PP2A-beta, encoded by separate genes.
 - Protein phosphatase-2B  (PP2B or calcineurin), a  calcium-dependent  enzyme
   whose activity is stimulated by calmodulin. It is composed of two subunits:
   the catalytic A-subunit and the calcium-binding B-subunit.  The specificity
   of PP2B is restricted.

In addition to the above-mentioned  enzymes, some  additional serine/threonine
specific protein phosphatases have been characterized and are listed below.

 - Mammalian phosphatase-X (PP-X), and  Drosophila  phosphatase-V (PP-V) which
   are closely related but yet distinct from PP2A.
 - Yeast  phosphatase  PPH3,  which  is  similar  to  PP2A, but with different
   enzymatic properties.
 - Drosophila  phosphatase-Y  (PP-Y),  and yeast phosphatases Z1 and Z2 (genes
   PPZ1 and PPZ2) which are closely related but yet distinct from PP1.
 - Drosophila  retinal  degeneration  protein C (gene rdgC), a calcium-binding
   phosphatase required to prevent light-induced retinal degeneration.
 - Phages Lambda and Phi-80 ORF-221  which have been shown to have phosphatase
   activity and are related to mammalian PP's.

The best   conserved   regions   in  these  proteins  is  a  highly  conserved
pentapeptide that can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMN]-[KR]-G-N-H-E
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for rdgC which has Asn in front of the conserved arginine.

* Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit PR55 signatures *
*************************************************************

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a   serine/threonine  phosphatase involved in
many  aspects of  cellular  function  including   the  regulation of metabolic
enzymes and  proteins  involved  in  signal  transduction.  PP2A is a trimeric
enzyme that consists of a core composed of a catalytic subunit associated with
a 65 Kd  regulatory subunit (PR65),  also called subunit A;  this complex then
associates with a third  variable subunit (subunit B),  which confers distinct
properties to the holoenzyme [1].  One of the forms of the variable subunit is
a 55  Kd  protein  (PR55)  which  is highly conserved in mammals - where three
isoforms are known to exist -, Drosophila and yeast (gene CDC55). This subunit
could perform a substrate recognition function or be responsible for targeting
the enzyme complex to the appropriate subcellular compartment.

As signature  patterns, we selected  two  perfectly  conserved sequences of 15
residues; one  located  in  the  N-terminal region, the other in the center of
the protein.

* Protein phosphatase 2C signature *
************************************

Protein phosphatase  2C  (PP2C)  is one of the four major classes of mammalian
serine/threonine  specific protein  phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.16).  PP2C [1] is a
monomeric enzyme  of about 42 Kd which shows   broad substrate specificity and
is dependent  on  divalent  cations  (mainly  manganese and magnesium) for its
activity. Its  exact  physiological  role is still unclear. Three isozymes are
currently known  in mammals: PP2C-alpha, -beta and -gamma. In yeast, there are
at least  four  PP2C  homologs:  phosphatase  PTC1 [2] which has weak tyrosine
phosphatase activity in addition to its activity on serines, phosphatases PTC2
and PTC3,  and  hypothetical  protein YBR125c. Isozymes of PP2C are also known
from Arabidopsis   thaliana   (ABI1,  PPH1),  Caenorhabditis  elegans  (FEM-2,
F42G9.1, T23F11.1), Leishmania chagasi and Paramecium tetraurelia.

In Arabidopsis  thaliana, the kinase associated protein phosphatase (KAPP) [3]
is an  enzyme  that dephosphorylates the Ser/Thr receptor-like kinase RLK5 and
which contains a C-terminal PP2C domain.

PP2C does  not  seem  to be evolutionary related to the main family of serine/
threonine phosphatases:  PP1,  PP2A  and  PP2B . However,  it is significantly
similar to    the  catalytic  subunit  of  pyruvate  dehydrogenase phosphatase
(EC 3.1.3.43)  (PDPC)  [4],  which catalyzes dephosphorylation and concomitant
reactivation of  the  alpha  subunit  of  the  E1  component  of  the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex.    PDPC  is a  mitochondrial  enzyme and, like PP2C, is
magnesium-dependent.

As a signature pattern, we selected the best conserved region which is located
in the  N-terminal  part  and  contains a perfectly conserved tripeptide. This
region includes  a  conserved  aspartate  residue  involved in divalent cation
binding [5].

* Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases signature and profiles *
*****************************************************************

Tyrosine specific protein phosphatases  (EC 3.1.3.48)  (PTPase) [1 to 5]   are
enzymes  that catalyze the removal of a phosphate group attached to a tyrosine
residue.  These  enzymes  are  very  important in  the control of cell growth,
proliferation, differentiation and transformation.   Multiple  forms of PTPase
have been characterized  and   can be  classified into two categories: soluble
PTPases and transmembrane receptor proteins that contain PTPase domain(s). The
currently known PTPases are listed below:

Soluble PTPases.

 - PTPN1 (PTP-1B).
 - PTPN2 (T-cell PTPase; TC-PTP).
 - PTPN3  (H1)  and PTPN4  (MEG), enzymes that contain an N-terminal band 4.1-
   like domain  (see  <PDOC00566>)  and  could  act  at  junctions between the
   membrane and cytoskeleton.
 - PTPN5 (STEP).
 - PTPN6  (PTP-1C;  HCP; SHP) and PTPN11 (PTP-2C; SH-PTP3; Syp), enzymes which
   contain two  copies  of  the  SH2  domain  at its N-terminal extremity. The
   Drosophila protein corkscrew (gene csw) also belongs to this subgroup.
 - PTPN7 (LC-PTP; Hematopoietic protein-tyrosine phosphatase; HePTP).
 - PTPN8 (70Z-PEP).
 - PTPN9 (MEG2).
 - PTPN12 (PTP-G1; PTP-P19).

 - Yeast PTP1.
 - Yeast PTP2  which  may  be  involved    in  the  ubiquitin-mediated protein
   degradation pathway.
 - Fission  yeast  pyp1  and pyp2 which play a role in inhibiting the onset of
   mitosis.
 - Fission yeast pyp3 which contributes to the dephosphorylation of cdc2.
 - Yeast CDC14 which may be involved in chromosome segregation.
 - Yersinia virulence plasmid PTPAses (gene yopH).
 - Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus 19 Kd PTPase.

Dual specificity PTPases.

 - DUSP1 (PTPN10; MAP kinase phosphatase-1; MKP-1); which dephosphorylates MAP
   kinase on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185.
 - DUSP2 (PAC-1), a nuclear enzyme that dephosphorylates  MAP kinases ERK1 and
   ERK2 on both Thr and Tyr residues.
 - DUSP3 (VHR).
 - DUSP4 (HVH2).
 - DUSP5 (HVH3).
 - DUSP6 (Pyst1; MKP-3).
 - DUSP7 (Pyst2; MKP-X).
 - Yeast MSG5, a PTPase that dephosphorylates MAP kinase FUS3.
 - Yeast YVH1.
 - Vaccinia virus H1 PTPase; a dual specificity phosphatase.

Receptor PTPases.

Structurally, all known receptor PTPases, are  made  up  of  a variable length
extracellular domain,  followed    by a  transmembrane region and a C-terminal
catalytic cytoplasmic domain. Some of the receptor PTPases contain fibronectin
type III   (FN-III)  repeats,  immunoglobulin-like  domains,  MAM  domains  or
carbonic anhydrase-like domains in their extracellular region. The cytoplasmic
region generally  contains two copies of the PTPAse domain. The first seems to
have enzymatic    activity,  while  the second is inactive but seems to affect
substrate specificity  of  the first. In these domains, the catalytic cysteine
is generally conserved but some other, presumably important, residues are not.

In the  following  table,  the  domain  structure of known receptor PTPases is
shown:

PTPase  domains  consist  of about 300  amino  acids.  There are two conserved
cysteines, the  second  one  has  been  shown  to  be  absolutely required for
activity. Furthermore,  a  number  of  conserved  residues  in  its  immediate
vicinity have also been shown to be important.

We derived  a signature pattern for PTPase domains centered on the active site
cysteine.

There are three profiles for PTPases, the  first one spans the complete domain
and is not specific to any subtype.  The  second profile is  specific to dual-
specificity PTPases and the third one to the PTP subfamily.

* Inositol monophosphatase family signatures *
**********************************************

It has been shown [1] that several proteins share two sequence motifs.  Two of
these  proteins  are  enzymes  of  the  inositol  phosphate  second  messenger
signalling pathway:

 - Vertebrate and plants inositol monophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.25).
 - Vertebrate inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.57).

The function of the other proteins is not yet clear:

 - Bacterial  protein  cysQ.  CysQ  could  help  to  control  the pool of PAPS
   (3'-phosphoadenoside 5'-phosphosulfate), or be useful in sulfite synthesis.
 - Escherichia coli protein suhB.  Mutations  in  suhB results in the enhanced
   synthesis of heat shock sigma factor (htpR).
 - Neurospora crassa protein Qa-X. Probably involved in quinate metabolism.
 - Emericella nidulans protein qutG. Probably involved in quinate metabolism.
 - Yeast  protein  HAL2/MET22  [2]  involved  in  salt  tolerance  as  well as
   methionine biosynthesis.
 - Yeast hypothetical hypothetical protein YHR046c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F13G3.5.
 - A Rhizobium leguminosarum hypothetical protein encoded  upstream of the pss
   gene for exopolysaccharide synthesis.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0109.

It is suggested [1] that these proteins may  act by enhancing the synthesis or
degradation of phosphorylated messenger molecules. From the X-ray structure of
human  inositol monophosphatase [3], it  seems  that  some  of  the  conserved
residues are involved in binding a metal ion and/or the phosphate group of the
substrate.

* Prokaryotic zinc-dependent phospholipase C signature *

Bacillus cereus expresses  a phosphatidylcholine  hydrolyzing  phospholipase C
(EC 3.1.4.3) (PLC) which  is a  monomeric  protein  of 245 amino-acid residues
that binds three zinc ions [1].  This  PLC is  highly similar to the following
proteins:

 - Alpha-toxin from Clostridium  perfringens and bifermentans  which  are also
   zinc-dependent phospholipases C [2].
 - Lecithinase C from Listeria monocytogenes [3].

In Bacillus  cereus,  there  are nine residues known to be involved in binding
the zinc ions: 5 His, 2 Asp, 1 Glu and 1 Trp. These residues are all conserved
in the Clostridium alpha-toxin.

As a signature pattern  for  this  family  of enzymes, we selected a conserved
region of 11 residues  that  contains  three  of the zinc ligands: a histidine
involved in  binding the first zinc ion, an aspartic acid which binds both the
first and the third zinc ion, and a histidine which binds the second zinc ion.

* Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C profiles *
**********************************************************

Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase  C  (EC  3.1.4.11),  an eukaryotic
intracellular enzyme, plays an important role in signal transduction processes
[1]. It   catalyzes  the  hydrolysis  of  1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-
triphosphate into  the second messenger molecules diacylglycerol and inositol-
1,4,5-triphosphate. This catalytic process is tightly regulated  by reversible
phosphorylation and binding of regulatory proteins [2 to 4].

In mammals, there  are at least 6 different isoforms of PI-PLC, they differ in
their domain structure, their regulation, and their tissue distribution. Lower
eukaryotes also possess multiple isoforms of PI-PLC.

All eukaryotic PI-PLCs  contain two regions of homology, sometimes referred to
as 'X-box'  and  'Y-box'.  The  order  of these two regions is always the same
(NH2-X-Y-COOH), but  the  spacing  is variable. In most isoforms, the distance
between these  two  regions  is only 50-100 residues but in the gamma isoforms
one PH domain,  two  SH2 domains,  and one SH3 domain are inserted between the
two PLC-specific  domains.  The  two  conserved  regions have been shown to be
important for the catalytic activity. At the C-terminal of the Y-box, there is
a C2 domain  (see  <PDOC00380>)  possibly  involved  in  Ca-dependent membrane
attachment.

By profile analysis, we  could show that sequences with significant similarity
to the  X-box  domain  occur  also  in prokaryotic and trypanosome PI-specific
phospholipases C.  Apart  from  this  region,  the prokaryotic enzymes show no
similarity to their eukaryotic counterparts.

We developed two profiles, one covering the X-box, the other the Y-box.

3'5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (EC 3.1.4.17) (PDEases) catalyze the
hydrolysis of cAMP  or cGMP to the  corresponding nucleoside 5' monophosphates
[1]. There are at least seven different subfamilies of PDEases [2,E1]:

 - Type 1, calmodulin/calcium-dependent PDEases.
 - Type 2, cGMP-stimulated PDEases.
 - Type 3, cGMP-inhibited PDEases.
 - Type 4, cAMP-specific PDEases.
 - Type 5, cGMP-specific PDEases.
 - Type 6, rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP-specific PDEases.
 - Type 7, High affinity cAMP-specific PDEases.

All of these forms seem to  share a conserved domain of about 270 residues. We
have derived a signature  pattern  from a stretch of 12 residues that contains
two conserved histidines.

Cyclic  AMP  phosphodiesterase   (EC 3.1.4.17)  (cAMP-PDEase)   catalyzes  the
hydrolysis of  cAMP to  the  corresponding nucleoside 5' monophosphate.  While
most PDEases can be, on  the  basis of sequence similarities, grouped together
[1], there are at least two enzymes which do not  belong to the main family of
PDEases and which represent a second class of these enzymes [2]:

 - Slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum extracellular cAMP PDEase.  This enzyme
   plays an essential role in  development  by  hydrolyzing the cAMP used as a
   chemoattractant by aggregating cells.
 - Budding yeast and Candida albicans low-affinity cAMP PDEase (gene PDE1).
 - Fission yeast probable cAMP PDEase (gene cgs2).
 - Vibrio fischeri periplasmic cAMP PDEase (gene cpdP) [3].

There is, in the central part of  these enzymes,  a  highly  conserved  region
which contains three histidines.  We  have  used  this  region  as a signature
pattern.

* Sulfatases signatures *
*************************

Sulfatases (EC 3.1.6.-) are enzymes that hydrolyze various sulfate esters. The
sequence of different types of sulfatases are available. These enzymes are:

 - Arylsulfatase A (EC 3.1.6.8)  (ASA), a lysosomal  enzyme  which  hydrolyzes
   cerebroside sulfate.
 - Arylsulfatase B (EC 3.1.6.12) (ASB),  a  lysosomal enzyme  which hydrolyzes
   the sulfate ester group from  N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate  residues  of
   dermatan sulfate.
 - Arylsulfatase C (ASD).
 - Arylsulfatase E (ASE).
 - Steryl-sulfatase  (EC 3.1.6.2) (STS)  (arylsulfatase C),  a  membrane bound
   microsomal enzyme which hydrolyzes 3-beta-hydroxy steroid sulfates.
 - Iduronate 2-sulfatase precursor (EC 3.1.6.13)  (IDS),  a  lysosomal  enzyme
   that hydrolyzes the 2-sulfate  groups  from  non-reducing-terminal iduronic
   acid residues in dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.
 - N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase  (EC 3.1.6.4),  an enzyme that hydrolyzes
   the 6-sulfate  groups  of  the  N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 6-sulfate units of
   chondroitin sulfate and the D-galactose 6-sulfate units of keratan sulfate.
 - Choline  sulfatase  (EC  3.1.6.6)  (gene  betC),  a  bacterial  enzyme that
   converts choline-O-sulfate to choline.
 - Glucosamine-6-sulfatase   (EC 3.1.6.14)  (G6S),  a  lysosomal  enzyme  that
   hydrolyzes the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  6-sulfate  units  of heparan sulfate
   and keratan sulfate.
 - N-sulphoglucosamine   sulphohydrolase  (EC  3.10.1.1)  (sulphamidase),  the
   lysosomal enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-sulfo-d-glucosamine into
   glucosamine and sulfate.

 - Sea urchin embryo arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1).
 - Green  alga  arylsulfatase (EC 3.1.6.1), an enzyme which plays an important
   role in the mineralization of sulfates.
 - Arylsulfatase  (EC  3.1.6.1)  from Escherichia coli (gene aslA), Klebsiella
   aerogenes (gene atsA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gene atsA).
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidJ.

It has been shown that all these sulfatases are structurally related [1,2,3].

As signature patterns for that family of enzymes we have selected the two best
conserved regions. Both regions are located in the N-terminal section of these
enzymes.   The  first  region  contains  a conserved arginine which  could  be
implicated in  the  catalytic  mechanism;  it is located four residues after a
position that,  in  eukaryotic  sulfatases,  is a conserved cysteine which has
been shown  [4] to be modified to 2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid. In prokaryotes,
this cysteine is replaced by a serine.

* Phosphotriesterase family signatures *
****************************************

Bacteria such  as  Pseudomonas diminuta harbor a plasmid that carries the gene
for the  enzyme phosphotriesterase (EC 3.1.8.1) (PTE) (also known as parathion
hydrolase). This enzyme has attracted interest because of its potential use in
the detoxification  of  chemical  waste  and warfare agents and its ability to
degrade agricultural  pesticides  such  as  parathion.  It act specifically on
synthetic organophosphate triesters and phosphorofluoridates. It does not seem
to have  a  natural occuring substrate and may thus have optimally evolved for
utilizing paraoxon.

PTE belongs  to  a family [1,2] of enzymes that possess a binuclear zinc metal
center at  their  active site. This family so far includes, in addition to the
parathion hydrolase, the following proteins:

 - Escherichia coli protein php. The substrate of php is not yet known.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein Rv0230C.
 - Mammalian phosphotriesterase related protein (PTER) (RPR-1).

The two  zinc  ions  are  coordinated  by six different residues, six of which
being histidines. We  have developed two signature patterns for this family of
enzymes. The first signature corresponds to a region located in the N-terminal
section that contains two histidines that bind the first of the two zinc ions.
The second  signature  is  located  in  the  central  region  and  contains an
histidine that binds the second zinc ion.

* AP endonucleases family 1 signatures *
****************************************

DNA damaging agents such as the antitumor drugs bleomycin and neocarzinostatin
or those  that  generate  oxygen radicals produce a variety of lesions in DNA.
Amongst these  is  base-loss  which  forms apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites or
strand breaks with atypical 3'termini. DNA repair at the AP sites is initiated
by specific   endonuclease  cleavage  of  the  phosphodiester  backbone.  Such
endonucleases are  also generally capable of removing blocking groups from the
3'terminus of DNA strand breaks.

AP endonucleases  can be classified into two families on the basis of sequence
similarity. What we call family 1 groups the enzymes listed below [1].

 - Escherichia coli exonuclease III (EC 3.1.11.2) (gene xthA).
 - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis exonuclease A (gene exoA).
 - Mammalian AP endonuclease 1 (AP1) (EC 4.2.99.18).
 - Drosophila recombination repair protein 1 (gene Rrp1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana apurinic endonuclease-redox protein (gene arp).

Except for  Rrp1  and  arp, these enzymes are proteins of about 300 amino-acid
residues.  Rrp1 and arp both  contain  additional  and  unrelated sequences in
their N-terminal section (about 400 residues for Rrp1 and 270 for arp).

We developed three signature patterns for this family of enzymes. The patterns
are based  on  the  most  conserved  regions.  The  first  pattern  contains a
glutamate which  has  been shown [2], in the Escherichia coli enzyme to bind a
divalent metal ion such as magnesium or manganese

APN1 and  nfo  have  been shown [3] to be transition metalloproteins that bind
three zinc ions.   The  metal-binding  sites have been determined from the 3D-

We developed three signature patterns for this family of enzymes. The patterns

* Deoxyribonuclease I signatures *
**********************************

Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (EC 3.1.21.1) [1] is  a  vertebrate enzyme which
catalyzes the   endonucleolytic    cleavage  of  double-stranded  DNA  to  5'-
phosphodinucleotide  and 5'-phosphooligonucleotide end-products. DNase I is an
enzyme involved  in  DNA  degradation; it is normally secreted outside  of the
cell but  seems to be able to gain access to the nucleus  where it is involved
in cell death by apoptosis [2].

As shown  in the following schematic representation, DNase I is a glycoprotein
of about 260 residues with two conserved disulfide bonds.

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

'*': position of the patterns.

DNase I has a pH-optimum  around  7.5  and requires  calcium and magnesium for
full activity. It causes single strand nicks in duplex DNA. A proton acceptor-
donor chain   composed   of  an  histidine  and  a  glutamic  acid  produce  a
nucleophilic hydroxyl  ion  from  water,  which  cleaves  the 3'-P-O bond [3].
DNase I  is  inhibited  by  actin  with  which  it  forms a stoechiometric 1:1
complex [4].

The sequence of DNase I is evolutionary related to that of:

 - Human muscle-specific DNase-like protein (gene DNASE1L1 or DNL1L) [5].
 - Human protein DHP1 (gene DNASE1L2) [6].
 - Human protein DHP2 (gene DNASE1L3) [6].

The first disulfide bond of DNase I is not conserved in the above proteins.

supercoiled DNA  by  nicking  to  strands  with  the  same  polarity  at sites
symmetrically opposed  at  the  junction  in  the homologous arms and leaves a

It is  a  small protein of about 20 Kd. It requires and binds a magnesium ion.

* Endonuclease III signatures *
*******************************

Escherichia coli  endonuclease  III  (EC  4.2.99.18)  (gene  nth) [1] is a DNA
repair enzyme  that  acts  both  as  a  DNA  N-glycosylase,  removing oxidized
pyrimidines from  DNA,  and  as  an  apurinic/apyrimidinic  (AP) endonuclease,
introducing a  single-strand  nick at the site from which the damaged base was
removed. Endonuclease III is an iron-sulfur protein that binds a single 4Fe-4S
cluster. The  4Fe-4S  cluster  does  not  seem  to  be important for catalytic
activity, but  is  probably  involved  in the proper positioning of the enzyme
along the DNA strand [2].

Endonuclease III is evolutionary related to the following proteins:

 - Fission yeast endonuclease III homolog (gene nth1) [3].
 - Escherichia coli and related protein DNA repair protein mutY, which  is  an
   adenine glycosylase.  MutY  is  a  larger  protein  (350  amino acids) than
   endonuclease III (211 amino acids).
 - Micrococcus  luteus  ultraviolet  N-glycosylase/AP  lyase  which  initiates
   repair at cis-syn pyrimidine dimers.
 - ORF10 in plasmid pFV1 of  the  thermophilic archaebacteria Methanobacterium
   thermoformicicum [4].  Restriction methylase m.MthTI,  which  is encoded by
   this plasmid, generates 5-methylcytosine which  is  subject  to deamination
   resulting in G-T mismatches. This protein could correct these mismatches.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YAL015c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC26A3.02.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R10E4.5.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0613.

The 4Fe-4S cluster is bound by four cysteines which  are  all  located in a 17
amino acid region at the C-terminal end of endonuclease III.  A similar region
is also present in the central section of mutY and in  the C-terminus of ORF10
and of  the  Micrococcus  UV  endonuclease. The 4Fe-4S cluster region does not
exist in YAL015c.

We developed two signature patterns for these proteins:  the first corresponds
to the  core  of the iron-sulfur binding domain, the second corresponds to the
best conserved region in the catalytic core of these enzymes.

* Ribonuclease II family signature *
************************************

On the basis of sequence similarities, the following bacterial  and eukaryotic
proteins seem to form a family:

 - Escherichia coli and  related bacteria ribonuclease II (EC 3.1.13.1) (RNase
   II) (gene  rnb)  [1]. RNase II is an exonuclease involved in mRNA decay. It
   degrades mRNA    by    hydrolyzing    single-stranded   polyribonucleotides
   processively in the 3' to 5' direction.
 - Bacterial ribnuclease R [2], a 3'-5'exoribonuclease that participates in an
   essential cell function.
 - Yeast protein SSD1 (or SRK1) which is implicated in the control of the cell
   cycle G1 phase.
 - Yeast  protein  DIS3  [3],  which  binds  to ran (GSP1) and ehances the the
   nucleotide-releasing activity of RCC1 on ran.
 - Fission yeast protein dis3, which is implicated in mitotic control.
 - Neurospora crassa cyt-4, a mitochondrial protein required for RNA 5' and 3'
   end processing and splicing.
 - Yeast protein MSU1, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.
 - Synechocystis  strain PCC 6803 protein zam [4], which control resistance to
   the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F48E8.6.

The size of these proteins range from 644 residues (rnb) to 1250 (SSD1). While
their sequence is highly divergent they share a  conserved  domain in their C-
terminal section  [5].  It  is  possible  that  this  domain plays a role in a
putative exonuclease  function  that would be common to all these proteins. We
have developed a signature pattern based on the core of this conserved domain.

* Bacterial ribonuclease P protein component signature *
********************************************************

Ribonuclease P (EC 3.1.26.5) (RNase P) [1,2,3] is a site specific endonuclease
that generates  mature tRNAs by  cleaving-off  the  leader sequences  at their
5'ends. In bacteria RNase P is known to be composed of two components: a large
(about 400 base pairs) RNA (gene rnpB) and  a small  protein (119 to 133 amino
acids) (gene rnpA).  The RNA moiety of RNase P carries the catalytic activity;
the function of the protein component  is not yet clear although it may act as
an electrostatic screen  allowing  the  highly  negatively charged RNA enzyme-
substrate complex to fold into the catalytic conformation.

The sequence of rnpA is not highly conserved, however there is, in the central
part of the  protein,  a conserved basic region. We have used this region as a
signature pattern.

* Ribonuclease T2 family histidine active sites *
*************************************************

The fungal ribonucleases T2 from Aspergillus oryzae, M from Aspergillus saitoi
and Rh from Rhizopeus niveus  are structurally  and functionally related 30 Kd
glycoproteins [1] that cleave the 3'-5' internucleotide  linkage  of RNA via a
nucleotide 2',3'-cyclic phosphate intermediates (EC 3.1.27.1).

A number of other RNAses  have  been found to be evolutionary related to these
fungal enzymes:

 - Self-incompatibility [2]  in  flowering  plants  is  often  controlled by a
   single gene   (S-gene)   that  has  several  alleles.  This  gene  prevents
   fertilization by  self-pollen  or  by  pollen  bearing either of the two S-
   alleles expressed  in the style. The self-incompatibility glycoprotein from
   several higher  plants of the solanaceae family has  been shown [2,3] to be
   a ribonuclease.
 - Phosphate-starvation  induced  RNAses  LE and LX from tomato [4]. These two
   enzymes are probably involved in a phosphate-starvation rescue system.
 - Escherichia coli periplasmic RNAse I (EC 3.1.27.6) (gene rna) [5].
 - Aeromonas hydrophila periplasmic RNAse.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical protein HI0526.

Two histidines residues have been shown [6,7]  to be involved in the catalytic
mechanism of RNase T2 and Rh.  These  residues  and the region around them are
highly conserved in all  the sequence described above.  We  have developed two
signature patterns, one  for  each  of  the two  active-site  histidines.  The
second pattern  also  contains  a cysteine which is  known to be involved in a
disulfide bond.

 - Frog liver ribonuclease and frog sialic acid-binding lectin [6].

The signature pattern we  developed for these proteins includes five conserved

A family  of  bacterial  and  eukaryotic endonucleases (EC 3.1.30.-) share the
following characteristics:  they  act  on  both  DNA  and  RNA, cleave double-
stranded and  single-standed  nucleic acids and require a divalent ion such as
magnesium for their activity. The enzymes that belongs to this family are:

 - Extracellular nuclease from Serratia marcescens.

 - DNA-entry nuclease from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 - Mammalian mitochondrial endonuclease G (endo G).

 - Nuclease C1 from the fungi Cunninghamella echinulata.

An histidine  has  been  shown  [1]  to  be  essential for the activity of the

Gram-positive, thermophilic  anaerobes  such  as  Clostridium thermocellum  or
Clostridium cellulolyticum secretes a highly active and thermostable cellulase
complex (cellulosome) responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose
[1,2]. The cellulosome contains at least  30 polypeptides, the majority of the
enzymes are endoglucanases  (EC 3.2.1.4), but  there  are  also some xylanases
(EC 3.2.1.8), beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) and endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases
(EC 3.2.1.73).

Complete sequence data for many of these enzymes has been obtained. A majority
of these proteins contain a highly conserved region of about 65 to 70 residues
which is generally (but not always)  located  in  the C-terminus.  This region
contains a  duplicated  segment  of  24  amino acids.   The  function  of this
duplicated segment is not yet known, although it  has  been  suggested that it
could be involved in substrate-binding or in calcium-binding [3].

Currently this domain has been found in:

 - Endoglucanases A (celA), B (celB), D (celD), E (celE),  F (celF), G (celG),
   H (celH) and X (celX) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Endoglucanases  A  (celCCA),  C  (celCCC),  D  (celCCD),  F  (celCCF) and G
   (celCCG) from Clostridium cellulolyticum.
 - Endoglucanase B (engB) from Clostridium cellulovorans.
 - Xylanases Y (XynY) and Z (xynZ) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Endo-beta-1,3-1,4 glucanase (licB) from Clostridium thermocellum.
 - Cellulose  integrating  protein  (cipA) from Clostridium thermocellum. CipA
   acts as  a  scaffolding  protein in the cellulosome. It promotes binding of
   cellulose to the catalytic domains of the cellulolytic enzymes [4].

The pattern  we  developed  spans the first 20 positions of the 24 amino acids
segment.

Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that  catalyze the  hydrolysis of the
beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  linkages in  chitin polymers.  From  the view
point of sequence similarity  chitinases  belong to either  family 18 or 19 in
the classification  of  glycosyl  hydrolases  [2,E1].  Chitinases of family 18
(also known as classes III or V) groups a variety of proteins:

 a) Chitinases from:

 - Prokaryotes such as Alteromonas, Bacillus, Serratia, Streptomyces, etc.
 - Plants such as Arabidopsis, cucumber, bean, tobacco, etc.
 - Fungi such as Aphanocladium, Rhizopus, Saccharomyces, etc.
 - Nematode (Brugia malayi).
 - Insects (Manduca sexta).
 - Baculoviruses (Autographa Californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis virus).

 b) Other proteins:

 - Hevamine, a rubber tree protein with chitinase and lysozyme activities.
 - Kluyveromyces lactis killer toxin alpha subunit, which acts as a chitinase.
 - Flavobacterium and Streptomyces endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.
   1.96).
 - Mammalian  di-N-acetylchitobiase  which  is  involved in the degradation of
   asparagine-linked glycoproteins.
 - Human cartilage glycoprotein Gp-39.
 - Jack  bean  concanavalin  B  (conB),  a protein that has lost its catalytic
   activity.

Site directed mutagenesis experiments [3] and crystallographic data [4,5] have
shown that  a  conserved  glutamate is involved in the catalytic mechanism and
probably acts as a proton donor. This  glutamate is  at  the  extremity of the
best conserved region in these proteins.

* Chitinases family 19 signatures *
***********************************

Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) [1] are enzymes that  catalyze the  hydrolysis of the
beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine  linkages in  chitin polymers.  From  the view
point of sequence similarity  chitinases  belong to either  family 18 or 19 in
the classification  of  glycosyl  hydrolases  [2,E1].  Chitinases of family 19
(also known  as  classes  IA  or  I and IB or II) are enzymes from plants that
function in  the  defense  against  fungal  and insect pathogens by destroying
their chitin-containing  cell wall. Class IA/I and IB/II enzymes differ in the
presence (IA/I)  or absence (IB/II) of a N-terminal chitin-binding domain (see
the relevant entry <PDOC00025>). The catalytic domain of these enzymes consist
of about 220 to 230 amino acid residues.

As signature patterns we selected two highly conserved regions,  the first one
is located in the N-terminal section  and  contains  one  of the six cysteines
which are conserved  in  most, if  not all, of  these  chitinases and which is
probably involved in a disulfide bond.

* Alpha-lactalbumin / lysozyme C signature *
********************************************

Alpha-lactalbumin [1], a milk protein, is  the  regulatory  subunit of lactose
synthetase. In the  mammary  gland,  alpha-lactalbumin  changes  the substrate
specificity of galactosyltransferase from N-acetylglucosamine to glucose.

Lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17) [2]  act  as bacteriolytic  enzymes by hydrolyzing the
beta(1->4) bonds  between N-acetylglucosamine  and N-acetylmuramic acid in the
peptidoglycan of  prokaryotic  cell walls.   There are at least five different
classes of lysozymes [3,4]: C (chicken type), G (goose type), phage-type (T4),
fungi  (Chalaropsis), and  bacterial  (Bacillus subtilis)  but there  are  few
similarities in the sequences of the different types of lysozymes.

Alpha-lactalbumin and lysozyme C are  evolutionary related [5].  Around  35 to
40% of the residues are conserved in both proteins as well as the positions of
the four disulfide bonds (see the schematic representation).   The pattern for
this family of proteins includes  three  cysteines  involved  in  two of these
disulfide bonds (the first cysteine is linked to the third one).

* Alpha-galactosidase signature *
*********************************

Alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) (melibiase) [1]  catalyzes the hydrolysis of
melibiose into galactose and glucose. In man, the deficiency of this enzyme is
the cause of Fabry's disease (X-linked sphingolipidosis).  Alpha-galactosidase
is present  in a  variety of organisms.  There  is  a  considerable  degree of
similarity in  the  sequence of  alpha-galactosidase  from  various eukaryotic
species.

Escherichia coli alpha-galactosidase  (gene melA),   which  requires  NAD  and
magnesium as cofactors, is not structurally related to the eukaryotic enzymes;
by contrast, an  Escherichia coli  plasmid  encoded  alpha-galactosidase (gene
rafA) [2] contains  a  region  of  about  50 amino acids which is similar to a
domain of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases.

Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.49) [3] catalyzes the hydrolysis  of
terminal non-reducing  N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues in  N-acetyl-alpha-D-
galactosaminides.  In man,  the deficiency  of  this enzyme  is  the cause  of
Schindler and Kanzaki diseases. The sequence  of this enzyme is highly related
to that of the eukaryotic alpha-galactosidases.

We selected, as a  signature pattern for these enzymes, the N-terminal part of
the conserved  domain.  The  pattern  contains  two  conserved  aspartic  acid
residues which could be involved in the catalytic mechanism.

Alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) [1] is a  lysosomal  enzyme  responsible  for

N-acetylglucosamine  of the carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins. Deficiency
of alpha-L-fucosidase results in the lysosomal storage disease fucosidosis.

A cysteine residue is important for the activity of the enzyme.  There is only
one cysteine conserved  between  the sequence of  mammalian alpha-L-fucosidase
and that of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. We have derived a pattern
from the region around that conserved cysteine.

It has been shown [1 to 4] that the  following  glycosyl hydrolases can be, on
the basis of sequence similarities, classified into a single family:

 - Beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) from various bacteria such as Agrobacterium
   strain ATCC 21400, Bacillus polymyxa, and Caldocellum saccharolyticum.
 - Two plants (clover) beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21).
 - Two  different  beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23)  from  the archaebacteria
   Sulfolobus solfataricus (genes bgaS and lacS).
 - 6-phospho-beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.85) from  various  bacteria such as
   Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Staphylococcus aureus.
 - 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.86) from Escherichia coli (genes bglB
   and ascB) and from Erwinia chrysanthemi (gene arbB).
 - Plants myrosinases (EC 3.2.3.1) (sinigrinase) (thioglucosidase).
 - Mammalian lactase-phlorizin hydrolase  (LPH)  (EC 3.2.1.108 / EC 3.2.1.62).
   LPH, an integral membrane glycoprotein, is  the  enzyme that splits lactose
   in the small intestine. LPH is a large protein of about 1900 residues which
   contains four tandem repeats  of  a  domain  of about 450 residues which is
   evolutionary related to the above glycosyl hydrolases.

One of the conserved regions in  these enzymes  is  centered  on  a  conserved
glutamic acid residue which has been  shown [5], in the beta-glucosidase  from
Agrobacterium, to  be directly involved  in glycosidic bond cleavage by acting
as a nucleophile. We have used this region as a signature pattern. As a second
signature pattern  we  selected  a  conserved region,  found in the N-terminal
extremity of these enzymes, this region also contains a glutamic acid residue.

proteins of about 50 Kd. As a signature pattern we selected a conserved region
located in the central section. This region does not contain residues directly
shown to be important for the catalytic activity.

The microbial degradation  of cellulose and  xylans requires  several types of
enzymes such as endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4),  cellobiohydrolases (EC 3.2.1.91)
(exoglucanases), or xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) [1,2].  Fungi and bacteria produces
a spectrum of cellulolytic  enzymes (cellulases)  and  xylanases which, on the
basis of sequence similarities,  can be classified into families. One of these
families is known as the cellulase family A [3] or as  the glycosyl hydrolases
family 5  [4,E1].    The  enzymes  which are currently known to belong to this
family are listed below.

 - Endoglucanases from various species and strains of Bacillus.
 - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endoglucanases 1 (end1) and A (celA).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum bifunctional endoglucanase/exoglucanase (celB).
   This protein consists of two  domains; it  is  the C-terminal domain, which
   has endoglucanase activity, which belongs to this family.
 - Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase (eglA).
 - Clostridium cellulolyticum endoglucanases A (celccA) and D (celccD).
 - Clostridium cellulovorans endoglucanase B (engB) and D (engD).
 - Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanases B (celB),   C (celC),  E (celE),  G
   (celG) and H (celH).
 - Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase Z (celZ).
 - Fibrobacter succinogenes endoglucanase 3 (cel-3).
 - Pseudomonas fluorescens endoglucanase C (celC).
 - Pseudomonas solanacearum endoglucanase (egl).
 - Robillarda strain Y-20 endoglucanase I.
 - Ruminococcus albus endoglucanases I (EG-I), A (celA), and B (celB).

 - Streptomyces lividans endoglucanase.
 - Thermomonospora fusca endoglucanase E-5 (celE).
 - Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II (EGLII).
 - Xanthomonas campestris endoglucanase (engxcA).

As well as:

 - Baker's yeast glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase I/II (EC 3.2.1.58) (EXG1).
 - Baker's yeast glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase 2 (EC 3.2.1.58) (EXG2).
 - Baker's yeast sporulation-specific glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (SPR1).
 - Caldocellum saccharolyticum beta-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) (manA).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR056w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIR007w.

One of the  conserved regions in  these enzymes  contains a conserved glutamic
acid  residue  which is  potentially  involved [5] in the catalytic mechanism.
We use this region as a signature pattern.

*******************************************

It has  been  shown  [1,2]  that  the  following  glycosyl  hydrolases  can be
classified into a single family on the basis of sequence similarities:

 - Glucan  endo-1,3-beta-glucosidases    (EC 3.2.1.39)      (endo-(1->3)-beta-
   glucanase) from various plants.  This enzyme may be involved in the defense
   of plants against pathogens through its ability to degrade fungal cell wall
   polysaccharides.
 - Glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.58)  (exo-(1->3)-beta-glucanase) from
   yeast (gene BGL2). This enzyme  may play  a  role  in cell expansion during
   growth, in cell-cell  fusion  during  mating,  and  in spore release during
   sporulation.
 - Lichenases (EC 3.2.1.73)   (endo-(1->3,1->4)-beta-glucanase)  from  various
   plants.

The best conserved region in the sequence of these enzymes is located in their
central section. This  region  contains  a  conserved tryptophan residue which
could be involved in  the  interaction with  the  glucan substrates [2] and it
also contains  a  conserved  glutamate  which has been shown [3] to act as the
nucleophile in  the  catalytic  mechanism.  We  have  used  this  region  as a
signature pattern.

It has been shown [1,2,3,E1] that the following glycosyl hydrolases can be, on
the basis of sequence similarities, classified into a single family:

 - Lysosomal alpha-glucosidase  (EC 3.2.1.20) (acid maltase)  is  a vertebrate
   glycosidase active at low pH, which  hydrolyzes alpha(1->4) and alpha(1->6)
   linkages in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose.
 - Alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) from the yeast Candida tsukunbaensis.
 - Alpha-glucosidase   (EC   3.2.1.20)  (gene  malA)  from  the  archebacteria
   Sulfolobus solfataricus.
 - Intestinal sucrase-isomaltase  (EC 3.2.1.48 / EC 3.2.1.10) is  a vertebrate
   membrane-bound, multifunctional  enzyme  complex  which hydrolyzes sucrose,
   maltose and isomaltose.  The  sucrase  and isomaltase domains of the enzyme
   are homologous (41% of amino acid identity)  and have most probably evolved
   by duplication.
 - Glucoamylase  1  (EC 3.2.1.3)  (glucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase) from  various
   fungal species.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR229c.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC30D11.01c.

An aspartic acid has been implicated [4] in the catalytic activity of sucrase,
isomaltase,  and lysosomal alpha-glucosidase.  The  region around  this active
residue is  highly  conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.  We have
used a second region, which contains two conserved cysteines, as an additional
signature pattern.

Beta-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) from mammals, fungi, plants and the bacteria
Xanthomonas manihotis are evolutionary related [1,2]. They belong to family 35
in the classification of glycosyl hydrolases [3,E1].

Mammalian beta-galactosidase  is  a lysosomal enzyme (gene GLB1) which cleaves

glycosaminoglycans and  whose  deficiency  is the cause of the genetic disease
Gm(1) gangliosidosis (Morquio disease type B).

On of  the  best  conserved  regions in these enzymes contains a glutamic acid

Bacterial lytic transglycosylases degrade murein via cleavage of the beta-1,4-
glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, with the
concomitant  formation  of  a  1,6-anhydrobond  in  the  muramic acid residue.
Escherichia coli  has  at  least  three different lytic transglycosylases: two
soluble isozymes  of 65 Kd and 35 Kd and a membrane-bound enzyme of 38 Kd. The
sequence of  the  65 Kd enzyme (gene slt) has been determined [1]. A domain of
about 90  residues  located  near  the  C-terminal section of slt was recently
shown [2] to be present in a number of other prokaryotic and phage proteins:

 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase C (gene mltC).
 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase D (gene mltD).
 - Membrane-bound lytic murein transglycosylase E (gene mltE).
 - Phage  T7  internal  protein  D  which  may be involved in the lysis of the
   bacterial cell wall during the release of phage progeny.
 - Phage PRD1 gene 7 protein.
 - Alteromonas strain M-1 possible tributyltin chloride resistance protein.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfhD.

The domain  shared  by  these  proteins  could  be  involved  in     catalytic

which we used as a signature pattern. It contains two conserved serines and  a
glutamate which has been shown [3] to be involved in the catalytic mechanism.

Inosine-uridine preferring  nucleoside  hydrolase  (EC 3.2.2.1) (IU-nucleoside
hydrolase or  IUNH)  is  an  enzyme  first  identified  in  protozoan [1] that
catalyzes the hydrolysis of all of the commonly occuring purine and pyrimidine
nucleosides into  ribose  and  the  associated  base, but has a preference for
inosine and  uridine  as  substrates.  This  enzyme  is  important  for  these
parasitic organisms,  which  are  deficient in de novo synthsis of purines, to
salvage the host purine nucleosides.

IUNH from  Crithidia  fasciculata  has been sequenced and characterized, it is
an homotetrameric  enzyme of subunits of 34 Kd. An histidine has been shown to
be important  for  the catalytic mechanism, it acts a proton donor to activate
the hypoxanthine leaving group.

IUNH is  evolutionary  related  to  a  number of uncharacterized proteins from
various biological sources, notably:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yaaF.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybeK.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yeiK.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC17G8.02.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR400w.
 - An hypothetical protein from the archaebacteria Desulfurolobus ambivalens.

As a  signature  pattern  for  these  proteins, we selected a highly conserved

conserved aspartates that have been shown [2] to be located in the active site

methyladenine (EC 3.2.2.20),  and  one (gene alkA)  which  is  induced  during
adaptation to alkylation and which can remove a variety of alkylation products
(EC 3.2.2.21). Tag and alkA do not share any region of sequence similarity.

In yeast there is  an alkylbase DNA glycosidase (gene MAG1) [2,3],  which  can
remove 3-methyladenine or 7-methyladenine and which is structurally related to
alkA.

MAG and alkA are both proteins of about 300 amino acid residues.  While the C-
and N-terminal ends appear to be unrelated, there is a central region of about
130 residues which is well conserved.  As a signature pattern we have selected
part of this region.

* Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase signature *
*************************************************

Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase  (EC  3.2.2.23) [1] (Fapy-DNA glycosylase)
(gene fpg)  is  a  bacterial  enzyme  involved  in DNA repair and which excise
oxidized purine  bases  to  release  2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5N-methylformamido-
pyrimidine (Fapy)  and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-OxoG) residues. In addition
to its  glycosylase  activity,  FPG can also nick DNA at apurinic/apyrimidinic
sites (AP  sites).  FPG  is a monomeric protein of about 32 Kd which binds and
require zinc for its activity.

Endonuclease VIII  (EC  3.2.-.-)  (gene nei) is a DNA N-glycosylase with an AP
lyase activity. It is evolutionary related to FPG.

The binding  site  for  zinc seems to be located in the C-terminal part of the
enzyme where  fours conserved and essential [2] cysteines are located. We have
developed a signature pattern based on this region.

* Uracil-DNA glycosylase signature *
************************************

Uracil-DNA glycosylase (EC 3.2.2.-)  (UNG) [1] is  a  DNA repair  enzyme  that
excises uracil residues from DNA by cleaving the N-glycosylic bond.  Uracil in
DNA can arise as  a  result  of  misincorportation  of  dUMP residues  by  DNA
polymerase or deamination of cytosine.

The sequence of uracil-DNA  glycosylase  is  extremely  well  conserved [2] in
bacteria and  eukaryotes  as well as in herpes viruses. More distantly related
uracil-DNA  glycosylases are also found in poxviruses [3].

In eukaryotic  cells,  UNG activity  is  found  in  both  the  nucleus and the
mitochondria. Human  UNG1  protein is transported to both the mitochondria and
the nucleus [4]. The N-terminal 77 amino acids of UNG1 seem to be required for
mitochondrial localization  [4],  but  the presence of a mitochondrial transit
peptide has not been directly demonstrated.

As  a  signature  for  this type  of  enzyme, we  selected the most N-terminal
conserved region. This region contains an aspartic acid residue which has been
proposed, based  on  X-ray  structures  [5,6]  to act as a general base in the
catalytic mechanism.

 cyclins [9]. Data available on three proteins proposed to be human uracil-DNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase  (EC  3.3.1.1) (AdoHcyase) is an enzyme of
the activated  methyl  cycle, responsible for the reversible hydratation of S-

ubiquitous enzyme which binds and requires NAD+ as a cofactor.

************************************

Cytosol  aminopeptidase is a eukaryotic cytosolic  zinc-dependent exopeptidase
that catalyzes  the removal  of unsubstituted  amino-acid  residues  from  the
N-terminus of proteins. This enzyme is  often  known as leucine aminopeptidase
(EC 3.4.11.1) (LAP)  but  has  been shown [1]  to  be  identical  with  prolyl
aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.5). Cytosol aminopeptidase is a hexamer of identical
chains, each of which binds two zinc ions.

Cytosol aminopeptidase is highly similar to Escherichia coli pepA, a manganese
dependent aminopeptidase.  Residues  involved  in  zinc ion-binding [2] in the
mammalian enzyme are  absolutely  conserved in pepA where they presumably bind
manganese. Most bacterial species contain a pepA-type enzyme.

As a signature pattern  for these  enzymes, we  selected a perfectly conserved
octapeptide which  contains  two  residues  involved in binding metal ions: an
aspartate and a glutamate.

and uncharged.  All  MAP  studied  to date are monomeric proteins that require
cobalt ions for activity.

Two subfamilies  of  MAP  enzymes  are  known  to  exist  [1,2].  While  being

mostly clustered  around  the residues shown, in the Escherichia coli MAP [3],
to be involved in cobalt-binding.

The first  family  consists  of enzymes from prokaryotes as well as eukaryotic
MAP-1, while  the second group is made up of archebacterial MAP and eukaryotic
MAP-2. The  second  subfamily  also  includes proteins which do not seem to be

* Zinc carboxypeptidases, zinc-binding regions signatures *
***********************************************************

There are a number of  different types of zinc-dependent carboxypeptidases (EC
3.4.17.-) [1,2].   All these enzymes seem  to be structurally and functionally
related. The enzymes that belong to this family are listed below.

 - Carboxypeptidase A1 (EC 3.4.17.1), a pancreatic  digestive  enzyme that can
   removes all C-terminal amino acids with the exception of Arg, Lys and Pro.
 - Carboxypeptidase A2 (EC 3.4.17.15), a  pancreatic digestive  enzyme  with a
   specificity similar to that of  carboxypeptidase A1,  but with a preference
   for bulkier C-terminal residues.
 - Carboxypeptidase B (EC 3.4.17.2), also a  pancreatic  digestive enzyme, but
   that preferentially removes C-terminal Arg and Lys.
 - Carboxypeptidase N (EC 3.4.17.3) (also known as arginine carboxypeptidase),
   a plasma  enzyme   which  protects  the body  from  potent  vasoactive  and
   inflammatory  peptides  containing C-terminal Arg or Lys (such as kinins or
   anaphylatoxins) which are released into the circulation.
 - Carboxypeptidase H (EC 3.4.17.10) (also known as  enkephalin  convertase or
   carboxypeptidase E), an enzyme located in  secretory granules of pancreatic
   islets, adrenal gland, pituitary and brain. This enzyme removes residual C-
   terminal Arg or Lys  remaining  after  initial endoprotease cleavage during
   prohormone processing.
 - Carboxypeptidase M (EC 3.4.17.12),  a  membrane  bound Arg and Lys specific
   enzyme.
   It is ideally situated to  act  on  peptide  hormones at local tissue sites
   where it could control  their  activity  before  or  after interaction with
   specific plasma membrane receptors.
 - Mast cell carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.17.1),  an  enzyme  with  a  specificity
   to carboxypeptidase A, but  found in the secretory  granules of mast cells.
 - Streptomyces griseus  carboxypeptidase (Cpase SG)  (EC 3.4.17.-) [3], which
   combines the specificities of mammalian carboxypeptidases A and B.
 - Thermoactinomyces  vulgaris  carboxypeptidase T  (EC 3.4.17.18) (CPT)  [4],
   which also combines the specificities of carboxypeptidases A and B.
 - AEBP1 [5], a transcriptional repressor active in preadipocytes. AEBP1 seems
   to regulate transcription by cleavage of other transcriptional proteins.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR132c.

All of  these  enzymes  bind  an  atom of zinc.  Three  conserved residues are
implicated in the binding of the zinc atom: two histidines and a glutamic acid
We have derived two signature patterns which contain these three zinc-ligands.

-Consensus pattern: [PK]-x-[LIVMFY]-x-[LIVMFY]-x(4)-H-[STAG]-x-E-x-[LIVM]-

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: Bacillus sphaericus endopeptidase I
 which hydrolyses  the  gamma-D-Glu-(L)meso-diaminopimelic  acid bond of spore

 - Bacillus licheniformis glutamate  specific  endopeptidase (GSE) [3],  which
   like V8 cleaves on the carboxyl-terminal  side of acidic residues, but with
   a strong preference for glutamate.
 - Bacillus subtilis extracellular "metalloprotease" (gene mpr) [4].

Escherichia coli  protease  VII  (EC 3.4.21.87) (omptin) (gene ompT) [1] is an
outer-membrane associated   protease  with  a  specificity  for  paired  basic
residues. It  seems  to be a serine protease inhibited by zinc ions. Omptin is
highly similar to the following proteins:

 - Salmonella  typhimurium  outer  membrane   protease E (gene pgtE) [2], also
   specific for paired basic residues.
 - Yersinia pestis coagulase/fibrinolysin  (plasminogen activator) (gene  pla)
   [3]. This  enzyme  is  encoded  on  a  plasmid required  for the pathogenic
   potential of the bacteria. It cleaves and activates plasminogen at the foci
   of infection; this allows plasmin to degrade fibrin barriers thus promoting
   the invasiveness of the plague bacteria.
 - Escherichia coli outer membrane protease ompP [4].

The mature  forms of these enzymes are proteins of about 280 to 300 amino-acid
residues. As signature patterns, we selected two well conserved regions in the
central part of these proteins.

* Prolyl oligopeptidase family serine active site *
***************************************************

The prolyl oligopeptidase family [1,2,3] consist  of  a number of evolutionary
related peptidases whose catalytic  activity seems  to be provided by a charge
relay system similar to  that of the trypsin family of  serine  proteases, but
which evolved by independent convergent evolution.   The known members of this
family are listed below.

 - Prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) (PE) (also called post-proline cleaving
   enzyme). PE is an enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds on  the C-terminal side
   of prolyl residues. The sequence of PE has been obtained  from  a mammalian
   species (pig)   and   from  bacteria  (Flavobacterium  meningosepticum  and
   Aeromonas hydrophila);  there  is  a  high  degree of sequence conservation
   between these sequences.
 - Escherichia  coli protease II (EC 3.4.21.83) (oligopeptidase B) (gene prtB)
   which cleaves  peptide  bonds on the C-terminal side of lysyl and argininyl
   residues.
 - Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) (DPP IV).   DPP IV is  an enzyme that
   removes  N-terminal   dipeptides  sequentially   from  polypeptides  having
   unsubstituted N-termini provided that the penultimate residue is proline.
 - Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A (DPAP A) (gene: STE13)  which is
   responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the alpha-factor precursor.
 - Yeast vacuolar dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP B) (gene: DAP2).
 - Acylamino-acid-releasing  enzyme  (EC 3.4.19.1)  (acyl-peptide  hydrolase).
   This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of  the amino-terminal peptide bond of
   an N-acetylated protein to generate a N-acetylated amino acid and a protein
   with a free amino-terminus.

A conserved serine residue has experimentally  been  shown (in E.coli protease
II as well  as  in  pig  and bacterial PE)  to  be necessary for the catalytic
mechanism. This serine, which is part of the catalytic  triad (Ser, His, Asp),
is generally located  about 150 residues away from the C-terminal extremity of
these enzymes  (which  are  all proteins  that contains about 700 to 800 amino
acids).

* Endopeptidase Clp active sites *
**********************************

The endopeptidase Clp (EC 3.4.21.92) from Escherichia coli cleaves peptides in
various proteins in a process that  requires  ATP  hydrolysis [1,2].  Clp is a
dimeric protein which consists of a proteolytic subunit (gene clpP) and either
of two related ATP-binding regulatory subunits (genes clpA and clpX).  ClpP is
a serine  protease  which  has  a chymotrypsin-like  activity.  Its  catalytic
activity seems to be  provided by a charge relay system similar to that of the
trypsin family   of   serine  proteases,  but  which  evolved  by  independent
convergent evolution.

Proteases highly  similar to ClpP  have been found to be encoded in the genome
of the chloroplast of plants and seem to be also present in other eukaryotes.

The sequences around two of the  residues  involved  in the catalytic triad (a
serine and a histidine)  are  highly  conserved  and  can be used as signature
patterns specific to that category of proteases.

******************************************************************

The following proteins belongs to a family of proteases which are dependent on
the hydrolysis  of  ATP  for  their  activity and which have a serine in their
active site:

 - Bacterial  ATP-dependent  proteases [1,2]. The prototype of those bacterial
   enzymes is  the  Escherichia coli La protease (EC 3.4.21.53) (gene lon). La
   is capable   of   hydrolyzing   large  proteins;  it  degrades  short-lived
   regulatory (such  as  rcsA  and  sulA)  and  abnormal  proteins.  It  is  a
   cytoplasmic protein  of  87  Kd  that  associates  as  an homotetramer. Its
   proteolytic activity is stimulated by single-stranded DNA.
 - Eukaryotic  mitochondrial  matrix  proteases [3,4].  The prototype of these
   enzymes is the yeast PIM1 protease. It is a mitochondrial matrix protein of
   120 Kd  that associated as an homohexamer. It catalyzes the initial step of
   mitochondrial protein degradation.
 - Haemophilus influenzae lon-B (HI1324), a protein which does not contain the
   ATP-binding domain,  but possess a slightly divergent form of the catalytic
   domain.

The region  around  the serine residue involved in the catalytic mechanism [5]
is perfectly conserved and can be used as a signature pattern.

-Consensus pattern: D-G-[PD]-S-A-[GS]-[LIVMCA]-[TA]-[LIVM]
                    [S is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: proteins belonging to this family  also contain a copy  of the ATP/GTP-
 binding motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).
-Note: these proteins belong to family S16 in the classification of peptidases
 [6,E1].

* Eukaryotic thiol (cysteine) proteases active sites *
******************************************************

Eukaryotic thiol proteases (EC 3.4.22.-) [1]  are  a  family  of   proteolytic
enzymes which contain an active site cysteine.   Catalysis  proceeds through a
thioester intermediate and is facilitated by a nearby histidine side chain; an
asparagine completes the essential catalytic triad.  The  proteases  which are
currently  known  to belong  to  this  family are listed below (references are
only provided for recently determined sequences).

 - Vertebrate  lysosomal  cathepsins B   (EC 3.4.22.1),   H  (EC 3.4.22.16), L
   (EC 3.4.22.15), and S (EC 3.4.22.27) [2].
 - Vertebrate lysosomal  dipeptidyl  peptidase I (EC 3.4.14.1)  (also known as
   cathepsin C) [2].
 - Vertebrate calpains  (EC 3.4.22.17).   Calpains  are intracellular calcium-
   activated thiol  protease that contain  both  a N-terminal catalytic domain
   and a C-terminal calcium-binding domain.
 - Mammalian cathepsin K, which seems involved in osteoclastic bone resorption
   [3].
 - Human cathepsin O [4].
 - Bleomycin hydrolase.  An  enzyme that  catalyzes  the  inactivation  of the
   antitumor drug BLM (a glycopeptide).
 - Plant enzymes: barley aleurain (EC 3.4.22.16), EP-B1/B4; kidney bean EP-C1,
   rice bean SH-EP;  kiwi fruit actinidin (EC 3.4.22.14);  papaya latex papain
   (EC 3.4.22.2),   chymopapain (EC 3.4.22.6),   caricain (EC 3.4.22.30),  and
   proteinase IV (EC 3.4.22.25); pea turgor-responsive protein 15A;  pineapple
   stem bromelain (EC 3.4.22.32); rape COT44;  rice  oryzain  alpha, beta, and
   gamma; tomato low-temperature induced, Arabidopsis thaliana A494, RD19A and
   RD21A.
 - House-dust mites allergens DerP1 and EurM1.
 - Cathepsin B-like proteinases from the  worms  Caenorhabditis elegans (genes
   gcp-1, cpr-3,  cpr-4,  cpr-5 and cpr-6), Schistosoma mansoni (antigen SM31)
   and Japonica  (antigen  SJ31),  Haemonchus contortus (genes AC-1 and AC-2),
   and Ostertagia ostertagi (CP-1 and CP-3).
 - Slime mold cysteine proteinases CP1 and CP2.
 - Cruzipain from Trypanosoma cruzi and brucei.
 - Throphozoite cysteine proteinase (TCP) from various Plasmodium species.
 - Proteases from Leishmania mexicana, Theileria annulata and Theileria parva.
 - Baculoviruses cathepsin-like enzyme (v-cath).
 - Drosophila  small  optic  lobes protein (gene sol), a neuronal protein that
   contains a calpain-like domain.
 - Yeast thiol protease BLH1/YCP1/LAP3.
 - Caenorhabditis   elegans   hypothetical  protein  C06G4.2,  a  calpain-like
   protein.

Two bacterial peptidases are also part of this family:

 - Aminopeptidase C from Lactococcus lactis (gene pepC) [5].
 - Thiol protease tpr from Porphyromonas gingivalis.

Three other  proteins  are  structurally  related to this family, but may have
lost their proteolytic activity.

 - Soybean  oil  body   protein P34. This protein has its active site cysteine
   replaced by a glycine.
 - Rat  testin, a sertoli cell secretory protein highly similar to cathepsin L
   but with  the  active  site  cysteine  is  replaced by a serine. Rat testin
   should not be confused with mouse testin which is a LIM-domain protein (see
   <PDOC00382>).
 - Plasmodium falciparum serine-repeat protein (SERA),  the  major blood stage
   antigen. This protein of 111 Kd possesses  a C-terminal thiol-protease-like
   domain [6], but the active site cysteine is replaced by a serine.

The sequences around the three active site residues are well conserved and can
be used as signature patterns.

-Consensus pattern: Q-x(3)-[GE]-x-C-[YW]-x(2)-[STAGC]-[STAGCV]
                    [C is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for P34, testins, SERA antigen, and Theileria annulara protease.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 5.

-Note: the residue in position 4 of the pattern is almost always cysteine; the
 only exceptions are calpains (Leu), bleomycin hydrolase (Ser) and  yeast YCP1
 (Ser).
-Note: the residue in position 5 of the pattern is always Gly except in papaya
 protease IV where it is Glu.

Ubiquitin  carboxyl-terminal  hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.15) (UCH) (deubiquitinating
enzymes) [1,2] are thiol proteases  that recognize  and  hydrolyze the peptide

One of  the  active site residues of class-I UCH [3] is a cysteine. We derived
a signature pattern from the region around that residue.

Interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (EC 3.4.22.36) (ICE) [1,2] is responsible
for the cleavage of the IL-1 beta precursor at an Asp-Ala bond to generate the
mature biologically  active  cytokine.  ICE  a  thiol protease composed of two
subunits of 10 (p10) and 20 Kd (p20), both derived by the autocleavage of a 45
Kd precursor  (p45). Two residues are implicated in the catalytic mechanism: a
cysteine and an histidine. They are located  in the P20 subunit after cleavage 
of  the  precursor.  ICE  belongs  to  a family  of  peptidases  [3] which  is
implicated in  programmed  cell  death  (apoptosis)  and which has been termed
'caspase' for cysteine aspase. ICE is known as Caspase-1 and the other members
of this family [4] are:

 - Caspase-2 (ICH-1, NEDD-2).
 - Caspase-3 (also  known  as apopain, CPP32, Yama), a protease which,  at the
   onset of  apoptosis,  proteolytically  cleaves  poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
   (see <PDOC00360>) at an Asp-Gly bond.
 - Caspase-4 (ICH-2, TX, ICErel-II).
 - Caspase-5 (ICH-3, TY, ICErel-III).
 - Caspase-6 (MCH-2).
 - Caspase-7 (MCH-3, ICE-LAP3, CMH-1, SCA-2, LICE2).
 - Caspase-8 (MCH-5, MACH, FLICE).

 - Caspase-11.
 - Caspase-12.
 - Caspase-13 (ERICE).

* Eukaryotic and viral aspartyl proteases signature and profile *
*****************************************************************

Aspartyl  proteases, also  known as acid proteases, (EC 3.4.23.-) are a widely
distributed family   of   proteolytic   enzymes  [1,2,3]  known  to  exist  in
vertebrates, fungi, plants, retroviruses and some plant viruses.     Aspartate
proteases of  eukaryotes are  monomeric  enzymes which consist of two domains.
Each domain contains an  active site centered on a catalytic aspartyl residue.
The two  domains  most  probably  evolved from the duplication of an ancestral
gene encoding   a  primordial  domain.  Currently  known  eukaryotic  aspartyl
proteases are:

 - Vertebrate gastric pepsins A and C (also known as gastricsin).
 - Vertebrate  chymosin  (rennin),  involved  in digestion and used for making
   cheese.
 - Vertebrate lysosomal cathepsins D (EC 3.4.23.5) and E (EC 3.4.23.34).
 - Mammalian renin (EC 3.4.23.15) whose function  is to generate angiotensin I
   from angiotensinogen in the plasma.
 - Fungal proteases such as aspergillopepsin A (EC 3.4.23.18),   candidapepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.24), mucoropepsin (EC 3.4.23.23) (mucor rennin),  endothiapepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.22),   polyporopepsin    (EC 3.4.23.29),    and   rhizopuspepsin
   (EC 3.4.23.21).
 - Yeast saccharopepsin (EC 3.4.23.25)  (proteinase A)  (gene PEP4).   PEP4 is
   implicated in posttranslational regulation of vacuolar hydrolases.
 - Yeast  barrierpepsin  (EC 3.4.23.35)  (gene BAR1);  a protease that cleaves
   alpha-factor and thus acts as an antagonist of the mating pheromone.
 - Fission  yeast sxa1 which is involved in degrading or processing the mating
   pheromones.

Most retroviruses and some plant  viruses, such as badnaviruses, encode for an
aspartyl protease  which  is an homodimer of  a chain of about 95 to 125 amino
acids. In  most  retroviruses, the  protease  is  encoded  as  a  segment of a
polyprotein which  is  cleaved  during the maturation process of the virus. It
is generally  part  of  the  pol  polyprotein  and,  more  rarely,  of the gag
polyprotein.

Conservation of  the sequence around the two aspartates of eukaryotic aspartyl
proteases and  around  the single active site of the viral proteases allows us
to  develop a single signature pattern for both groups of protease.  A profile
was developed  to  specifically  detect  viral  aspartyl  proteases, which are
missed by the pattern.

* Neutral zinc metallopeptidases, zinc-binding region signature *
*****************************************************************

The majority of zinc-dependent  metallopeptidases (with the  notable exception
of the  carboxypeptidases) share a common pattern of primary structure [1,2,3]
in the  part  of  their  sequence  involved in the binding of zinc, and can be
grouped together  as  a  superfamily,known  as the metzincins, on the basis of
this sequence  similarity.  They  can  be classified into a number of distinct
families [4,E1]  which  are  listed  below  along with the proteases which are
currently known to belong to these families.

 Family M1
 - Bacterial aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) (gene pepN).
 - Mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2).
 - Mammalian glutamyl aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.7) (aminopeptidase A).  It may
   play a role in  regulating growth  and  differentiation  of early B-lineage
   cells.
 - Yeast aminopeptidase yscII (gene APE2).
 - Yeast alanine/arginine aminopeptidase (gene AAP1).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIL137c.
 - Leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (EC 3.3.2.6). This enzyme is responsible  for the
   hydrolysis of an  epoxide moiety of LTA-4 to form LTB-4;  it has been shown
   that it binds zinc and is capable of peptidase activity.

 Family M2
 - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) (dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase I)
   (ACE) the enzyme  responsible  for hydrolyzing angiotensin I to angiotensin
   II. There  are  two  forms of ACE:  a testis-specific isozyme and a somatic
   isozyme which has two active centers.

 Family M3
 - Thimet  oligopeptidase  (EC 3.4.24.15),  a mammalian enzyme involved in the
   cytoplasmic degradation of small peptides.
 - Neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16)  (also known as mitochondrial oligopeptidase M or

*****************************
* Matrixins cysteine switch *
*****************************

Mammalian extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (EC 3.4.24.-), also known as
matrixins [1] (see <PDOC00129>), are zinc-dependent enzymes. They are secreted
by cells  in an inactive form (zymogen) that differs from the mature enzyme by
the presence  of  an  N-terminal propeptide. A highly conserved octapeptide is
found two  residues  downstream  of the C-terminal end of the propeptide. This
region has been shown to be  involved  in  autoinhibition  of matrixins [2,3];
a cysteine  within the octapeptide chelates  the  active  site  zinc ion, thus
inhibiting the  enzyme.  This  region has been called the 'cysteine switch' or
'autoinhibitor region'.

A cysteine switch has been found in the following zinc proteases:

 - MMP-1 (EC 3.4.24.7) (interstitial collagenase).
 - MMP-2 (EC 3.4.24.24) (72 Kd gelatinase).
 - MMP-3 (EC 3.4.24.17) (stromelysin-1).
 - MMP-7 (EC 3.4.24.23) (matrilysin).
 - MMP-8 (EC 3.4.24.34) (neutrophil collagenase).

* ADAM type metalloprotease domain profile *
********************************************

ADAMs are   transmembrane   proteins   containing   both  a  disintegrin  (see
<PDOC00351>) and a metalloprotease domain [1]. About two third of the proteins
with an  ADAM  type  metalloprotease  domain  also  contain  the zinc protease
pattern (see <PDOC00129>) which locates the active site of these proteases. As
they contain   an  adhesion  domain  and  a  protease  domain,  ADAM  proteins
potentially have  both cell adhesion and protease activities. They play a role
in various   biological   processes,  including  fertilization,  neurogenesis,
myogenesis, embryonic TGF-alpha release and inflammatory response [2].

ADAMTS proteins  [3]  form  a  closely  related  family of proteases. In these
proteins, the   metalloprotease   and   disintegrin  domains  are  flanked  by
thrombospondin type  I  (TSP1)  repeat  (see <PDOC50092>). ADAMTS proteins are
soluble, extracellular  matrix    proteases  those  known substrates are other
extracellular matrix proteins [2].

ADAM proteins  also share the metalloprotease and disintegrin domains with the
disintegrin class of peptides that are present in snake venom [2,4]. Together,
they form  the  adamlysin/reprolysin subfamily of the metzincin superfamily of
Zn-dependent metalloproteinases [4].

Some proteins  known  to  contain  an  ADAM  metalloprotease domain are listed
below:

 - Human  ADAM  1 and 2 (fertilin alpha and beta). Fertilins are sperm surface
   membrane proteins  that  may  be  involved  in  sperm-egg  plasma  membrane
   adhesion and fusion during fertilization. They lack proteolytic activity.
 - Human ADAM 8. It may be involved in immune function.
 - Drosophila  Kuzbanian.  It  is  involved  in  neurogenesis.  Kuzbanian is a
   sheddase that  has  been  found to release a soluble form of Delta, a Notch
   ligand.
 - Vertebrate ADAM 10, the homologue of Kuzbanian.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  Sup-17, the homologue of Kuzbanian. It is involved
   in Lin-12/NOTCH signaling.
 - Human ADAM 12 (meltrin alpha). It may be involved in myogenesis.
 - Several  snake venom metalloproteinases of the disintegrin family. They are
   not transmembrane proteins.
 - Mammalian    ADAMTS-1.  Protease  those expression is associated with acute
   inflammation as well as development of cancer cachexia.

****************************************************
* Insulinase family, zinc-binding region signature *
****************************************************

A number of proteases dependent on divalent cations  for  their activity  have
been shown [1,2] to belong to one family, on the basis of sequence similarity.
These enzymes are listed below.

 - Insulinase  (EC  3.4.24.56)  (also  known as insulysin or insulin-degrading
   enzyme or  IDE),  a  cytoplasmic  enzyme  which seems to be involved in the
   cellular  processing of insulin, glucagon and other small polypeptides.
 - Escherichia coli  protease III  (EC 3.4.24.55)  (pitrilysin)  (gene ptr), a
   periplasmic enzyme that degrades small peptides.
 - Mitochondrial  processing  peptidase  (EC  3.4.24.64)  (MPP).  This  enzyme
   removes the  transit  peptide  from the precursor form of proteins imported
   from the cytoplasm across the  mitochondrial inner membrane. It is composed
   of two  nonidentical  homologous subunits termed alpha and beta.  The  beta
   subunit seems  to  be  catalytically  active    while the alpha subunit has
   probably lost its activity.
 - Nardilysin (EC 3.4.24.61) (N-arginine dibasic convertase or NRD convertase)
   this mammalian  enzyme  cleaves peptide substrates on the N-terminus of Arg
   residues in dibasic stretches.
 - Klebsiella  pneumoniae  protein  pqqF.  This  protein  is  required for the
   biosynthesis of the coenzyme pyrrolo-quinoline-quinone (PQQ). It is thought
   to be  protease  that  cleaves peptide bonds in a small peptide (gene pqqA)
   thus providing  the  glutamate  and  tyrosine  residues  necessary  for the
   synthesis of PQQ.
 - Yeast protein AXL1, which is involved in axial budding [3].
 - Eimeria bovis sporozoite developmental protein.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein yddC and HI1368, the corresponding
   Haemophilus influenzae protein.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ymxG.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C28F5.4 and F56D2.1.

It should  be  noted  that  in addition to the above enzymes, this family also
includes the  core  proteins  I  and II of the mitochondrial bc1 complex (also
called cytochrome  c  reductase  or  complex III), but the situation as to the
activity or lack of activity of these subunits is quite complex:

 - In mammals and yeast, core proteins I and II lack enzymatic activity.
 - In Neurospora crassa and in potato core protein I is equivalent to the beta
   subunit of MPP.
 - In Euglena gracilis, core protein I seems to be active, while subunit II is
   inactive.

These proteins do not  share  many  regions of  sequence  similarity; the most
noticeable is  in  the  N-terminal  section.  This region includes a conserved
histidine followed,  two  residues later by a glutamate and another histidine.
In pitrilysin, it has been shown [4] that this H-x-x-E-H  motif is involved in
enzyme activity;  the two histidines bind zinc and the glutamate  is necessary
for catalytic activity. Non active members  of  this family have lost from one
to three of these active site residues. We  developed a signature pattern that
detect active members of this family as well as some inactive members.

-Consensus pattern: G-x(8,9)-G-x-[STA]-H-[LIVMFY]-[LIVMC]-[DERN]-[HRKL]-
                    [LMFAT]-x-[LFSTH]-x-[GSTAN]-[GST]
                    [The two H are zinc ligands]
                    [E is the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL   active
 members as  well  as  all  MPP  alpha subunits and core II subunits. Does not
 detect inactive core I subunits.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: these proteins belong to family M16 in the classification of peptidases
 [5,E1].

* Signal peptidases I signatures *
**********************************

Signal peptidases (SPases) [1]  (also  known  as leader peptidases) remove the
signal peptides from secretory proteins.  In prokaryotes three types of SPases
are known: type I (gene lepB) which is responsible for  the  processing of the
majority  of  exported pre-proteins;  type II (gene lsp)  which  only  process
lipoproteins, and a third type involved in the processing of pili subunits.

SPase I (EC 3.4.21.89) is an integral membrane protein that is anchored in the
cytoplasmic membrane  by  one (in B. subtilis)  or two (in E. coli) N-terminal
transmembrane domains  with  the  main  part  of the protein  protuding in the
periplasmic space. Two residues have  been shown [2,3] to be essential for the
catalytic activity of SPase I: a serine and an lysine.

SPase I  is  evolutionary  related  to  the yeast mitochondrial inner membrane
protease subunit 1  and 2 (genes IMP1 and IMP2) which  catalyze the removal of
signal peptides  required for the targeting of proteins from the mitochondrial
matrix, across the inner membrane, into the inter-membrane space [4].

In eukaryotes the removal  of signal  peptides  is  effected  by an oligomeric
enzymatic complex composed  of  at  least  five subunits: the signal peptidase
complex (SPC).  The SPC is located in the endoplasmic  reticulum membrane. Two
components  of mammalian SPC, the 18 Kd (SPC18) and the 21 Kd (SPC21) subunits
as well as  the yeast SEC11 subunit  have   been shown [5] to share regions of
sequence similarity with prokaryotic SPases I and yeast IMP1/IMP2.

We have developed  three  signature  patterns  for  these proteins.  The first
signature contains  the  putative active site  serine,  the  second  signature
contains the putative active  site  lysine  which  is not conserved in the SPC
subunits, and the third signature corresponds to a conserved region of unknown
biological significance  which  is  located  in  the C-terminal section of all
these proteins.

* Amidases signature *
**********************

It has been shown [1,2,3] that  several  enzymes  from various prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms which are involved in the hydrolysis of amides (amidases)
are evolutionary related. These enzymes are listed below.

 - Indoleacetamide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.-), a  bacterial plasmid-encoded enzyme
   that catalyzes the  hydrolysis  of  indole-3-acetamide (IAM) into indole-3-
   acetate (IAA), the  second  step  in  the   biosynthesis  of   auxins  from
   tryptophan.
 - Acetamidase  from  Emericella nidulans (gene amdS), an  enzyme which allows
   acetamide to be used as a sole carbon or nitrogen source.
 - Amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) from Rhodococcus sp. N-774 and Brevibacterium sp. R312
   (gene amdA). This enzyme hydrolyzes propionamides efficiently,  and also at
   a lower efficiency, acetamide, acrylamide and indoleacetamide.
 - Amidase (EC 3.5.1.4) from Pseudomonas chlororaphis.
 - 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer  hydrolase  (EC 3.5.2.12)   (nylon  oligomers
   degrading enzyme E1) (gene nylA), a bacterial plasmid  encoded enzyme which
   catalyzes the first  step in the degradation of 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic
   dimer, a by-product of nylon manufacture [4].
 - Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A [5].
 - Mammalian fatty acid amide hydrolase (gene FAAH) [6].
 - A putative amidase from yeast (gene AMD2).
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis putative amidases amiA2, amiB2, amiC and amiD.

All these enzymes contains in their central  section a highly conserved region
rich in glycine, serine, and alanine residues.  We  have used this region as a
signature pattern.

* Urease signatures *
*********************

Urease (EC 3.5.1.5) is a nickel-binding  enzyme that  catalyzes the hydrolysis
of  urea  to  carbon  dioxide and ammonia [1].  Historically, it was the first
enzyme  to  be crystallized  (in  1926).  It  is  mainly found in plant seeds,
microorganisms and  invertebrates. In plants, urease is a hexamer of identical
chains. In bacteria [2], it consists of either two or three different subunits
(alpha, beta and gamma).

Urease binds  two  nickel ions per subunit; four histidine, an aspartate and a
carbamated-lysine serve as ligands to these metals; an additional histidine is
involved in the catalytic mechanism [3].

As signatures  for  this  enzyme,  we  selected  a  region  that  contains two
histidine that  bind  one of the nickel ions and the region of the active site
histidine.

* ArgE / dapE / ACY1 / CPG2 / yscS family signatures *
******************************************************

The  following  enzymes  have   been   shown [1,2,3]  to be  evolutionary  and
functionally related:

 - In the biosynthetic pathway from glutamate to  arginine, the  removal of an
   acetyl group from  N2-acetylornithine can  be catalyzed  via  two  distinct
   enzymatic  strategies  depending on the organism.  In some  bacteria and in
   fungi, the   acetyl   group  is  transferred  on  glutamate  by   glutamate
   acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.35) while in enterobacteria such as Escherichia
   coli, it is   hydrolyzed  by   acetylornithine   deacetylase  (EC 3.5.1.16)
   (acetylornithinase) (AO) (gene argE). AO is a homodimeric  cobalt-dependent
   enzyme which displays broad specificity and can also deacylates  substrates
   such as acetylarginine, acetylhistidine, acetylglutamate semialdehyde, etc.
 - Succinyldiaminopimelate desuccinylase (EC 3.5.1.18)  (SDAP)  (gene dapE) is
   the enzyme  which  catalyzes  the  fifth step in the biosynthesis of lysine
   from aspartate  semialdehyde: the hydrolysis of succinyl-diaminopimelate to
   diaminopimelate and succinate. SDAP  is an  enzyme that  requires cobalt or
   zinc as a cofactor.
 - Aminoacylase-1   [4]  (EC 3.5.1.14)   (N-acyl-l-amino-acid  amidohydrolase)
   (ACY1). ACY1  is a homodimeric zinc-binding mammalian enzyme that catalyzes
   the hydrolysis of N-alpha-acylated amino acids (except for aspartate).
 - Carboxypeptidase G2 (EC 3.4.17.11) (folate  hydrolase G2)  (gene cpg2) from
   Pseudomonas strain RS-16.  This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of  reduced
   and non-reduced  folates  to  pteroates  and glutamate. G2 is a homodimeric
   zinc-dependent enzyme.
 - Vacuolar carboxypeptidase S (EC 3.4.17.4) (yscS) from yeast (gene CPS1).
 - Peptidase  T  (EC  3.4.11.-) (gene pepT) (tripeptidase) from bacteria. This
   enzyme catalyzes a variety of tripeptides containing N-terminal methionine,
   leucine, or phenylalanine.
 - Xaa-His dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.3)  (carnosinase)  from  Lactobacillus (gene
   pepV) [5],  a  metalloenzyme  with  activity against beta-alanyl-dipeptides
   including carnosine (beta-alanyl-histidine).

These enzymes  share  a  few characteristics. They hydrolyse peptidic bonds in
substrates that share a common structure, they are dependent on cobalt or zinc
for their  activity  and  they are proteins of 40 Kd to 60 Kd with a number of
regions of sequence similarity.

As signature patterns for  these  proteins, we  selected  two of the conserved
regions. The  first  pattern  contains  a  conserved  histidine which could be
involved in  binding  metal  ions  and the second pattern contains a number of
conserved charged residues.

*****************************
* Dihydroorotase signatures *
*****************************

Dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3) (DHOase)  catalyzes  the third step in the de novo
biosynthesis  of  pyrimidine,  the   conversion  of  ureidosuccinic  acid  (N-
carbamoyl-L-aspartate) into dihydroorotate.  Dihydroorotase  binds  a zinc ion
which is required for its catalytic activity [1].

In bacteria, DHOase is  a dimer  of  identical  chains of about 400 amino-acid
residues (gene pyrC).  In higher  eukaryotes, DHOase is part of a large multi-
functional protein known as 'rudimentary' in Drosophila and CAD in mammals and
which catalyzes  the  first  three  steps  of pyrimidine biosynthesis [2]. The
DHOase domain  is  located in the central part of this polyprotein. In yeasts,
DHOase is    encoded  by    a   monofunctional protein (gene URA4). However, a
defective DHOase domain [3] is found in a multifunctional protein  (gene URA2)
that catalyzes the first two steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis.

The comparison  of  DHOase sequences from various sources shows [4] that there
are two  highly  conserved  regions.  The  first  located  in  the  N-terminal
extremity contains  two  histidine  residues  suggested  [3] to be involved in
binding the zinc ion. The second is found in the C-terminal part. We developed
signature patterns for both regions.

Allantoinase (EC  3.5.2.5)  is  the  enzyme  that  hydrolyzes  allantoin  into
allantoate.  In yeast (gene DAL1) [5], it is the first enzyme in the allantoin
degradation pathway;  in amphibians [6] and fishs it catalyzes the second step
in the  degradation of uric acid. The sequence of allantoinase is evolutionary
related to that of DHOases.

******************************************************

Beta-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) [1,2]  are enzymes  which catalyze the hydrolysis
of an amide bond in  the  beta-lactam ring  of  antibiotics  belonging  to the
penicillin/cephalosporin  family.   Four  kinds of  beta-lactamase  have  been
identified [3]. Class-B enzymes are zinc containing  proteins whilst class -A,
C and D enzymes  are  serine hydrolases.  The  three  classes of serine  beta-
lactamases are  evolutionary related and belong to a superfamily [4] that also
includes DD-peptidases  and  a  variety  of  other penicillin-binding proteins
(PBP's). All these proteins contain a  Ser-x-x-Lys motif,  where the serine is
the active site residue.  Although  clearly  homologous,  the sequences of the
three classes of serine beta-lactamases exhibit a large degree  of variability
and only a small number of residues are conserved in addition to the catalytic
serine.

Since a  pattern  detecting all serine beta-lactamases would also pick up many
unrelated sequences,  we decided to provide specific patterns, centered on the
active site serine, for each of the three classes.

Beta-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) [1,2]  are enzymes  which catalyze the hydrolysis
of an amide bond in  the  beta-lactam ring  of  antibiotics  belonging  to the
penicillin/cephalosporin  family.  Four  kinds  of  beta-lactamase  have  been
identified [2].  Class-B enzymes are zinc containing proteins whilst class -A,
C and D enzymes  are  serine hydrolases.  Class-B  beta-lactamases  have  been
described in  several  Gram-negative bacterial species; they seem to share the
characteristic of  being  able to hydrolyze carbapenem compounds which are new
beta-lactam antibiotics of great therapeutic potential.

There are a number of conserved regions in the sequence of known class-B beta-
lactamases [3]. Most of them are centered on residues known [4] to be involved
in binding  the  zinc  ion  essential  for the enzyme's catalytic activity. We
designed two  signature  patterns for this class of enzyme. The first contains
three residues  involved  in  binding zinc ions. The second pattern contains a
cysteine which is also a zinc ligand.

Editase (EC 3.5.4.-)  are enzymes that catalyze the site-selective deamination
of adenosine  residue  into inosine within double stranded regions of mRNA. In
mRNA inosine  is  read as guanosine by the translation apparatus, resulting in
codon changes  within the synthesized protein. The editase domain contains the
active site and binds three zinc atoms [1].

Several editases  share  a  common  global  arrangement of domains. Hence, the
DRADA proteins  contain  two  DRADA  repeats  (see  <PDOC50139>), three double
stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBD) (see <PDOC50137>), and one editase domain
from N-  to  C-terminus,  while  the  RED1 and RED2 editases have a simplified
domains structure with no DRADA repeat and only two dsRBD [2].

Cytidine deaminase   (EC  3.5.4.5)  (cytidine  aminohydrolase)  catalyzes  the
hydrolysis of   cytidine   into  uridine  and  ammonia  while  deoxycytidylate
deaminase  (EC 3.5.4.12)  (dCMP  deaminase)  hydrolyzes  dCMP  into dUMP. Both
enzymes are known  to bind zinc and to require it for their catalytic activity
[1,2]. These  two  enzymes  do  not  share  any  sequence  similarity with the
exception of a region that  contains  three conserved histidine  and  cysteine
residues which are thought to be involved in the binding of the catalytic zinc
ion.

Such a region is also found in other proteins [3,4]:

 - Yeast cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.1) (gene FCY1) which transforms cytosine
   into uracil.
 - Mammalian  apolipoprotein  B  mRNA  editing  protein,  responsible  for the
   postranscriptional editing  of  a  CAA codon into a UAA (stop) codon in the
   APOB mRNA.

   deamination of  the  cytosine  moiety  of  the  antibiotics  blasticidin S,
   cytomycin and acetylblasticidin S.

GTP cyclohydrolase  I  (EC 3.5.4.16) catalyzes the biosynthesis of formic acid
and dihydroneopterin triphosphate from GTP. This reaction is the first step in
the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate in prokaryotes, of tetrahydrobiopterin in
vertebrates, and of pteridine-containing pigments in insects.

GTP cyclohydrolase  I is a protein of from 190 to 250 amino acid residues. The
comparison of the sequence of the enzyme from bacterial and eukaryotic sources
shows that  the  structure  of  this  enzyme has been extremely well conserved
throughout evolution [1].

As signature patterns we selected two conserved regions.  The first contains a
perfectly conserved  tetrapeptide which is part of the GTP-binding pocket [2],
the second region also contains conserved residues involved in GTP-binding.

Nitrilases  (EC 3.5.5.1)   are   enzymes  that  convert  nitriles  into  their
corresponding acids and ammonia. They are widespread in microbes as well as in
plants where    they    convert indole-3-acetonitrile to the hormone indole-3-
acetic acid.  A  conserved   cysteine has been shown [1,2] to be essential for
enzyme activity;  it  seems  to  be  involved  in a nucleophilic attack on the
nitrile carbon atom.

Cyanide hydratase (EC  4.2.1.66) converts HCN to formamide. In phytopathogenic
fungi, it  is  used  to  avoid the toxic effect of cyanide released by wounded
plants [3].  The sequence of cyanide hydrolase is evolutionary related to that
of nitrilases.

Yeast hypothetical proteins YIL164c and YIL165c also belong to this family.

As signature  patterns for  these  enzymes, we selected two conserved regions.
The first  is  located  in  the  N-terminal  section  while  the second, which

Inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.1) (PPase) [1,2] is the enzyme responsible
for the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) which  is  formed principally as the
product of the many biosynthetic reactions that utilize ATP.  All known PPases
require the presence of divalent metal cations, with magnesium  conferring the
highest activity.  Among other residues, a  lysine has  been  postulated to be
part or  close  to  the active site.  PPases have been sequenced from bacteria
such as Escherichia coli (homohexamer), thermophilic bacteria PS-3 and Thermus
thermophilus, from  the archaebacteria  Thermoplasma  acidophilum, from  fungi
(homodimer), from a plant, and from bovine retina.  In  yeast, a mitochondrial
isoform of PPase  has been characterized which  seems to be involved in energy
production and whose activity is stimulated by uncouplers of ATP synthesis.

The sequences  of PPases share  some  regions of  similarities.  As  signature

* ATP synthase alpha and beta subunits signature *
**************************************************

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.34) [1,2]  is a component
of the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,
and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of
an oligomeric transmembrane sector, called CF(0), and a catalytic core, called
coupling factor  CF(1).  The  former  acts  as a proton channel; the latter is
composed of  five  subunits,  alpha,  beta,  gamma,  delta  and  epsilon.  The
sequences of   subunits  alpha  and  beta  are  related  and  both  contain  a
nucleotide-binding site  for  ATP  and  ADP.  The  beta  chain  has  catalytic
activity, while the alpha chain is a regulatory subunit.

Vacuolar ATPases [3] (V-ATPases)  are  responsible for acidifying a variety of
intracellular  compartments  in  eukaryotic cells.  Like  F-ATPases,  they are
oligomeric complexes  of  a transmembrane and a catalytic sector. The sequence
of the  largest  subunit of the catalytic sector (70 Kd) is related to that of
F-ATPase beta subunit, while a 60 Kd subunit, from the same sector, is related
to the F-ATPases alpha subunit [4].

Archaebacterial membrane-associated  ATPases  are  composed of three subunits.
The alpha  chain  is  related  to  F-ATPases  beta chain and the beta chain is
related to F-ATPases alpha chain [4].

A protein  highly  similar  to  F-ATPase  beta  subunits  is found [5] in some
bacterial apparatus  involved  in  a  specialized  protein export pathway that
proceeds without  signal  peptide  cleavage.  This protein is known as fliI in
Bacillus and    Salmonella,    Spa47  (mxiB)  in  Shigella  flexneri, HrpB6 in
Xanthomonas campestris and yscN in Yersinia virulence plasmids.

In order to  detect these ATPase subunits, we took a segment of ten amino-acid
residues, containing two conserved serines, as a signature pattern.  The first
serine seems  to  be  important  for  catalysis - in the ATPase alpha chain at
least - as its mutagenesis causes catalytic impairment.

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.34) [1,2]  is a component
of the cytoplasmic membrane of eubacteria, the inner membrane of mitochondria,
and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of
an oligomeric transmembrane sector, called CF(0), and a catalytic core, called
coupling factor  CF(1).  The  former  acts  as a proton channel; the latter is
composed of  five  subunits,  alpha,  beta,  gamma, delta and epsilon. Subunit
gamma is believed to be important in regulating  ATPase  activity and the flow
of protons  through the CF(0) complex.  The best conserved region of the gamma
subunit [3] is its C-terminus  which  seems  to  be essential for assembly and
catalysis.  As a  signature pattern to detect ATPase gamma subunits, we used a
14 residue conserved segment  where the last  amino acid is found one to three
residues from the C-terminal extremity.

One of  the subunits of the ATPase complex, known as subunit delta in bacteria

mitochondria, seems  to  be  part  of  the stalk that links CF(0) to CF(1). It
either transmits  conformational  changes from CF(0) into CF(1) or is involved
in proton conduction [3].

The different delta/OSCP subunits are proteins of approximately 200 amino-acid
residues -  once  the  transit peptide has been removed in the chloroplast and
mitochondrial forms - which show only moderate sequence homology.

The signature pattern used to detect ATPase delta/OSCP subunits is  based on a
conserved region in the C-terminal section of these proteins.

The CF(0) a subunit, also called protein 6,  is  a key component of the proton

membrane. It  is  a  highly  hydrophobic  protein  that  has been predicted to
contain 8 transmembrane regions [3].

Sequence comparison of a subunits from all available sources reveals  very few
conserved regions.  The  best conserved region is located in what is predicted
to be    the fifth transmembrane domain.  This region contains three perfectly
conserved residues:  an  arginine,  a  leucine  and an asparagine. Mutagenesis
experiments carried  out  in Escherichia coli [4] have shown that the arginine
is necessary  for  proton  translocation  and  that its replacement by another
amino acid  results  in  loss of ATPase activity. We selected this region as a

ATP synthase (proton-translocating ATPase) (EC 3.6.1.34) [1,2]  is a component

and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.  The ATPase complex is composed of

The CF(0) c subunit (also called protein 9, proteolipid, or subunit III) [3,4]
is a highly hydrophobic protein of about 8 Kd which has been implicated in the
proton-conducting activity of ATPase. Structurally subunit c  consist  of  two
long  terminal  hydrophobic  regions, which probably span the membrane,  and a
central  hydrophilic region.   N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)  can  bind
covalently to subunit c and thereby abolish the ATPase activity. DCCD binds to
a specific glutamate or aspartate residue  which  is  located in the middle of
the second hydrophobic region near the C-terminus of the protein.

We derived a signature pattern which includes the DCCD-binding residue.

The sodium pump (Na+,K+ ATPase), located in the plasma membrane of  all animal
cells [1],  is  an  heterotrimer  of  a  catalytic  subunit  (alpha  chain), a
glycoprotein subunit  of  about  34  Kd  (beta  chain) and a small hydrophobic
protein of  about  6 Kd.   The beta subunit seems [2] to regulate, through the
assembly  of alpha/beta   heterodimers, the number of sodium pumps transported
to the plasma membrane.

Structurally the beta subunit is composed of a charged  cytoplasmic  domain of
about 35   residues,  followed  by  a  transmembrane    region,  and  a  large
extracellular  domain that contains three disulfide  bonds  and  glycosylation
sites. This structure is schematically represented in the figure below.

 - Yeast  guanosine-diphosphatase  (EC 3.6.1.42) (GDPase) (gene GDA1). GDA1 is
   a golgi  integral  membrane  enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GDP to

   lymphoid cell activation antigen CD39).
 - Toxoplasma gondii nucleoside-triphosphatases (EC 3.6.1.15) (NTPase). NTPase
   hydrolyses various  nucleoside  triphosphates  to produce the corresponding
   nucleoside mono-  and  diphosphates.  This  enzyme  is  secreted  into  the

cuticle. Cutinase allows pathogenic fungi to penetrate  through the host plant
cuticular barrier  during the initial stage of fungal infection. Cutinase is a
serine esterase  which  contains  the classical catalytic triad (Asp, Ser, and
His) found in the serine hydrolases [2].

Two cutinase-like  proteins (MtCY39.35 and MtCY339.08c) have been found in the
genome of the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The sequence  around  the catalytic residues is well conserved in the sequence

share regions of sequence similarity [1,2,3,4], especially in the vicinity  of
the lysine  residue  which  serves  as  the attachment site for the pyridoxal-
phosphate (PLP) group. These enzymes are:

 - Glutamate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) (GAD).  Catalyzes the decarboxylation
   of glutamate into the neurotransmitter GABA (4-aminobutanoate).
 - Histidine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.22) (HDC).  Catalyzes the decarboxylation

   those that  use  PLP    as  a cofactor (found in Gram-negative bacteria and
   mammals), and those that contain a covalently bound pyruvoyl residue (found
   in Gram-positive bacteria).
 - Aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.28)  (DDC),  also  known  as
   L-dopa  decarboxylase  or   tryptophan  decarboxylase.   DDC  catalyzes the

***************************************************************************

Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases  acting  on ornithine, lysine, arginine and
related substrates  can be classified into two different families on the basis
of sequence similarities [1,2]. The first family consists of:

 - Prokaryotic  ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) (ODC). ODC catalyzes the
   transformation of ornithine into putrescine.
 - Prokaryotic  lysine  decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.18) (LDC).  LDC catalyzes the
   transformation of lysine into cadaverine.
 - Escherichia coli biodegradative arginine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.19) (ADC).
   ADC catalyzes the transformation of arginine into agmatine.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yaaO.

One of the regions of sequence similarity contains a  conserved lysine residue
which is known, in Escherichia coli LDC [3] and in ADC [4], to be the site  of
attachment of  the pyridoxal-phosphate group.  We  have used this region  as a
signature pattern.

These enzymes are collectively known as group III decarboxylases [2].

* Orn/DAP/Arg decarboxylases family 2 signatures *
**************************************************

Pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases  acting  on ornithine, lysine, arginine and
related substrates  can be classified into two different families on the basis
of sequence similarities [1,2,3]. The second family consists of:

 - Eukaryotic  ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) (ODC).  ODC catalyzes the
   transformation of ornithine into putrescine.
 - Prokaryotic  diaminopimelic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.20) (DAPDC). DAPDC
   catalyzes the conversion of diaminopimelic acid into lysine; the last  step
   in the biosynthesis of lysine.
 - Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci protein tabA. tabA  is probably involved in
   the biosynthesis of tabtoxin and is highly similar to DAPDC.
 - Bacterial  and  plant  biosynthetic  arginine  decarboxylase  (EC 4.1.1.19)
   (ADC). ADC  catalyzes  the  transformation  of  arginine into agmatine, the
   first step in the biosynthesis of putrescine from arginine.

The above  proteins,  while  most  probably evolutionary related, do not share
extensive regions  of sequence similarities.  We selected two of the conserved
regions as  signature  patterns. The first pattern contains a conserved lysine
residue which is known, in mouse ODC [4], to be the site  of attachment of the
pyridoxal-phosphate group.  The  second  pattern  contains a  stretch of three
consecutive glycine residues and has  been proposed to be part of a substrate-
binding region [5].

These enzymes are collectively known as group IV decarboxylases [3].

Orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23) (OMPdecase) [1,2] catalyzes
the last step in the de novo  biosynthesis of pyrimidines, the decarboxylation
of OMP  into UMP.  In  higher  eukaryotes  OMPdecase  is  part,  with  orotate
phosphoribosyltransferase, of a bifunctional enzyme, while the prokaryotic and

Some parts of the sequence of OMPdecase are well conserved across species. The

centered around a lysine residue which is essential for the catalytic function
of the enzyme. We have used this region as a signature pattern.

* Citrate synthase signature *
******************************

Citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) (CS) is the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme that
catalyzes the  synthesis of citrate  from  oxaloacetate  and acetyl-CoA  in an
aldol condensation.  CS can directly form  a carbon-carbon bond in the absence
of metal ion cofactors.

In prokaryotes, citrate synthase is  composed of six  identical  subunits.  In
eukaryotes, there are two isozymes of citrate synthase: one is found    in the
mitochondrial matrix,  the  second  is  cytoplasmic. Both seem to be dimers of
identical chains.

There are a number of  regions of sequence  similarity between prokaryotic and
eukaryotic citrate  synthases.  One of the best conserved contains a histidine
which is  one  of  three  residues  shown  [1] to be involved in the catalytic
mechanism of  the  vertebrate  mitochondrial  enzyme. We used this region as a
signature pattern.

The following enzymes have  been  shown [1] to  be  functionally  as  well  as
evolutionary related:

 - Alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (EC 4.1.3.12) which catalyzes the first step
   in the biosynthesis of leucine,  the  condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-
   ketoisovalerate to form 2-isopropylmalate synthase.
 - Homocitrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.21) (gene nifV)  which  is  involved  in the

   the condensation of acetyl-CoA and alpha-ketoglutarate into homocitrate.

 - Soybean late nodulin 56.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical proteins MJ0503, MJ1195 and MJ1392.

We have selected  two   conserved  regions  as  signature patterns  for  these

A cysteine,  a  histidine  and  a glutamate or aspartate have been found to be

ICL is evolutionary related to two other type of enzymes:

In the  alga  Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii,  two CA isozymes have been sequenced

CAs. Some bacteria,  such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae [7] also have a eukaryotic-

CAs contain  a single  zinc  atom bound to three conserved histidine residues.
As a  signature  for  CAs  we used a pattern which includes one of these zinc-

Protein D8 from Vaccinia and  other poxviruses  is related to CAs but has lost

Carbonic anhydrases (EC 4.2.1.1) (CA) are zinc  metalloenzymes  which catalyze
the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide.

In Escherichia  coli,  CA  (gene cynT) is involved in recycling carbon dioxide
formed in the bicarbonate-dependent decomposition  of cyanate by cyanase (gene
cynS). By this action, it  prevents the depletion of cellular bicarbonate [1].
In photosynthetic bacteria and plant chloroplast, CA is essential to inorganic
carbon fixation [2].

Prokaryotic and plant chloroplast CA are structurally and evolutionary related
and form  a family distinct from the one which groups the many different forms
of eukaryotic CA's (see <PDOC00146>).

Hypothetical proteins  yadF  from Escherichia coli and HI1301 from Haemophilus
influenzae also belong to this family.

We developed two signature patterns for this family of enzymes.  Both patterns
contain conserved  residues  that  could be involved in binding zinc (cysteine
and histidine).

A number of enzymes, belonging  to  the lyase class,  for  which fumarate is a
substrate have been shown [1,2]  to  share a short conserved sequence around a
methionine which is  probably involved  in the catalytic activity of this type
of enzymes. These enzymes are:

 - Fumarase (EC 4.2.1.2) (fumarate hydratase), which catalyzes  the reversible
   hydration of fumarate to L-malate. There seem to be 2 classes of fumarases:
   class I are thermolabile dimeric enzymes  (as for example: Escherichia coli
   fumC); class II enzymes  are  thermostable  and tetrameric and are found in
   prokaryotes (as for example: Escherichia coli fumA and fumB) as well as  in
   eukaryotes.  The  sequence  of the two classes of fumarases are not closely
   related.
 - Aspartate  ammonia-lyase  (EC 4.3.1.1)  (aspartase),  which  catalyzes  the
   reversible conversion of  aspartate to fumarate and ammonia.  This reaction
   is analogous to that catalyzed by fumarase, except that ammonia rather than
   water is involved in the trans-elimination reaction.
 - Arginosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.1) (argininosuccinate lyase), which catalyzes the
   formation of arginine and fumarate from argininosuccinate, the last step in
   the biosynthesis of arginine.
 - Adenylosuccinase (EC 4.3.2.2) (adenylosuccinate lyase) [3], which catalyzes
   the eight step  in  the de novo  biosynthesis  of purines, the formation of
   5'-phosphoribosyl-5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide  and  fumarate  from 1-(5-
   phosphoribosyl)-4-(N-succino-carboxamide).  That enzyme  can also catalyzes
   the formation of fumarate and AMP from adenylosuccinate.
 - Pseudomonas  putida  3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.2)
   (3-carboxymuconate lactonizing  enzyme) (gene pcaB) [4], an enzyme involved

* Aconitase family signatures *
*******************************

Aconitase  (aconitate hydratase)  (EC  4.2.1.3) [1]  is  the enzyme  from  the
tricarboxylic  acid  cycle  that  catalyzes  the  reversible  isomerization of
citrate and isocitrate.  Cis-aconitate  is  formed  as an intermediary product
during the course of the reaction. In eukaryotes two isozymes of aconitase are
known to exist: one found in  the mitochondrial  matrix and the other found in
the cytoplasm. Aconitase, in its active form,  contains  a 4Fe-4S  iron-sulfur
cluster; three  cysteine  residues have been shown to be ligands of the 4Fe-4S
cluster.

It has  been  shown  that  the  aconitase  family  also contains the following
proteins:

 - Iron-responsive  element binding  protein (IRE-BP).  IRE-BP  is a cytosolic
   protein that binds  to iron-responsive elements (IREs).  IREs are stem-loop
   structures found in  the 5'UTR of ferritin,  and  delta aminolevulinic acid
   synthase mRNAs, and in the 3'UTR of  transferrin receptor mRNA. IRE-BP also
   express aconitase activity.
 - 3-isopropylmalate  dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.33)  (isopropylmalate  isomerase),
   the enzyme that catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of leucine.
 - Homoaconitase  (EC  4.2.1.36)  (homoaconitate  hydratase),  an  enzyme that
   participates in  the  alpha-aminoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and
   that converts cis-homoaconitate into homoisocitric acid.
 - Esherichia coli protein ybhJ.

cluster.

* Dihydroxy-acid and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratases signatures *
*****************************************************************

Two dehydratases have been shown [1] to be evolutionary related:

 - Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.9) (gene ilvD or ILV3) which catalyzes
   the fourth   step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  isoleucine  and  valine,  the
   dehydratation of  2,3-dihydroxy-isovaleic  acid  into  alpha-ketoisovaleric
   acid.
 - 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.12) (gene edd) which catalyzes the
   first step in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, the dehydratation of 6-phospho-
   D-gluconate into 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhG.

Both enzymes  are  proteins  of about 600 amino acid residues. We selected two
highly conserved  regions  as signature patterns. The first pattern is located
in the  N-terminal  part and contains a cysteine that could be involved in the
binding of  a 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster [2]. The second pattern is located in
the C-terminal half.

In fungi,  dehydroquinase  is part of a multifunctional enzyme which catalyzes
five consecutive  steps  in  the shikimate pathway. In aroD, it has been shown
[1] that  a  histidine  is  involved  in  the catalytic mechanism; we used the

Enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the dehydration of
2-phospho-D-glycerate to  phosphoenolpyruvate [1]. It is a dimeric enzyme that
requires magnesium both for catalysis  and   stabilizing the dimer. Enolase is
probably found in all  organisms that metabolize sugars. In vertebrates, there
are three  different  tissue-specific isozymes: alpha present in most tissues,
beta in muscles and gamma found only in nervous tissues.

Tau-crystallin,  one of  the major lens  proteins  in  some fish, reptiles and
birds, has been shown [2] to be evolutionary related to enolase.

* Serine/threonine dehydratases pyridoxal-phosphate attachment site  *
**********************************************************************

Serine and threonine  dehydratases [1,2]  are  functionally  and  structurally
related pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes:

 - L-serine dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.13) and D-serine  dehydratase  (EC 4.2.1.14)
   catalyze the dehydratation of L-serine (respectively D-serine) into ammonia
   and pyruvate.
 - Threonine dehydratase  (EC 4.2.1.16) (TDH) catalyzes  the  dehydratation of
   threonine into  alpha-ketobutarate  and  ammonia.  In Escherichia coli  and
   other microorganisms,  two  classes  of  TDH  are  known  to  exist. One is
   involved in  the  biosynthesis of isoleucine, the other in hydroxamino acid
   catabolism.

Threonine synthase  (EC 4.2.99.2) is  also  a pyridoxal-phosphate  enzyme,  it
catalyzes the  transformation of  homoserine-phosphate into threonine.  It has
been shown [3] that  threonine  synthase  is  distantly related to the serine/
threonine dehydratases.

In all these enzymes, the pyridoxal-phosphate group is  attached  to a  lysine
residue.  The sequence around  this residue is sufficiently conserved to allow
the derivation  of  a  pattern  specific  to serine/threonine dehydratases and
threonine synthases.

* Enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase signature *
*******************************************

Enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17)  (ECH) [1]  and 3-2trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase
(EC 5.3.3.8) (ECI) [2] are two enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism.  ECH
catalyzes the hydratation of 2-trans-enoyl-CoA into 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA  and ECI
shifts the 3- double  bond  of  the  intermediates  of  unsaturated fatty acid
oxidation to the 2-trans position.

Most eukaryotic cells have two fatty-acid  beta-oxidation systems, one located
in mitochondria and the other in peroxisomes. In mitochondria, ECH and ECI are
separate yet structurally related monofunctional enzymes.  Peroxisomes contain
a trifunctional  enzyme [3] consisting of an N-terminal domain that bears both
ECH and  ECI  activity, and a C-terminal domain responsible for 3-hydroxyacyl-
CoA dehydrogenase (HCDH) activity.

In Escherichia coli (gene fadB) and Pseudomonas fragi (gene faoA), ECH and ECI
are also  part  of  a multifunctional  enzyme which contains both a HCDH and a
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase domain [4].

A number  of other proteins  have been found to be evolutionary related to the
ECH/ECI enzymes or domains:

 - 3-hydroxbutyryl-coa  dehydratase  (EC  4.2.1.55)  (crotonase),  a bacterial
   enzyme involved in the butyrate/butanol-producing pathway.
 - Naphthoate  synthase  (EC 4.1.3.36)  (DHNA synthetase)  (gene menB) [5],  a
   bacterial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis  of menaquinone (vitamin K2).
   DHNA synthetase converts O-succinyl-benzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA) to 1,4-dihydroxy-
   2-naphthoic acid (DHNA).
 - 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.6) [6], a  Pseudomonas enzyme which
   catalyzes the conversion of 4-chlorobenzoate-CoA to 4-hydroxybenzoate-CoA.
 - A Rhodobacter capsulatus protein of unknown function (ORF257) [7].
 - Bacillus subtilis putative polyketide biosynthesis proteins pksH and pksI.
 - Escherichia coli carnitine racemase (gene caiD) [8].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ygfG.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YDR036c.

As a signature pattern for these enzymes, we selected  a conserved region rich
in glycine and hydrophobic residues.

specific to the  biosynthesis  of  lysine and  of  diaminopimelate.  DHDPS  is
responsible for the condensation of aspartate semialdehyde and pyruvate  by  a
ping-pong  mechanism  in which pyruvate first binds to the enzyme by forming a
Schiff-base with a lysine residue.

Three other  proteins  are structurally related to DHDPS and probably also act
via a similar catalytic mechanism:

 - Escherichia  coli N-acetylneuraminate lyase (EC 4.1.3.3) (gene nanA), which
   catalyzes the  condensation  of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate to form

 - Rhizobium  meliloti protein mosA [3], which is involved in the biosynthesis
   of the rhizopine 3-o-methyl-scyllo-inosamine.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yjhH.

We have  developed  two signature patterns for these enzymes. The first one is

Cysteine synthase  (EC  4.2.99.8) (CSase) is the pyridoxal-phosphate dependent
enzyme responsible [1] for the formation of  cysteine from O-acetyl-serine and
hydrogen sulfide with the concomitant release of acetic acid. In bacteria such
as Escherichia  coli, two forms of the enzyme are known (genes cysK and cysM).
In plants there are also two forms, one located in the cytoplasm and the other
in chloroplasts.

Cystathionine beta-synthase (EC 4.2.1.22) [2] catalyzes the first irreversible
step in  homocysteine transulfuration;  the  conjugation  of  homocysteine and
serine forming cystathionine. Like Csase it is a pyridoxal-phosphate dependent
enzyme.

The two  types  of  enzymes  are evolutionary related. The pyridoxal-phosphate
group of  CSases  has  been  shown to be attached to a lysine residue which is
located in  the N-terminal section of these enzymes; the sequence  around this
residue is  highly  conserved and can be used as a signature pattern to detect
this class of enzymes.

Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5) (PAL) is  a  key  enzyme of plant and
fungi  phenylpropanoid  metabolism  which is involved in the biosynthesis of a
wide  variety  of secondary metabolites such  as  flavanoids,   furanocoumarin
phytoalexins and  cell  wall  components.  These compounds have many important
roles in plants during normal growth and in responses to environmental stress.
PAL catalyzes  the  removal  of  an  ammonia  group from phenylalanine to form
trans-cinnamate.

Histidine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.3) (histidase)  catalyzes  the first step in
histidine degradation, the removal of  an  ammonia  group  from  histidine  to
produce urocanic acid.

The two types of enzymes are functionally and  structurally related [1].  They

A number   of  pyridoxal-dependent  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of

related. These are:

 - Cystathionine   gamma-lyase   (EC 4.4.1.1)   (gamma-cystathionase),   which
   catalyzes the  transformation  of cystathionine into cysteine, oxobutanoate
   and ammonia. This is the final reaction in the transulfuration pathway that
   leads from methionine to cysteine in eukaryotes.
 - Cystathionine  gamma-synthase (EC 4.2.99.9), which catalyzes the conversion
   of cysteine  and  succinyl-homoserine into cystathionine and succinate: the
   first step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  methionine from cysteine in bacteria
   (gene metB).
 - Cystathionine beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8) (beta-cystathionase), which catalyzes
   the conversion  of  cystathionine  into homocysteine, pyruvate and ammonia:
   the second step in the biosynthesis of methionine from cysteine in bacteria
   (gene metC).
 - Methionine  gamma-lyase  (EC 4.4.1.11) (L-methioninase) which catalyzes the
   transformation of methionine into methanethiol, oxobutanoate and ammonia.
 - OAH/OAS sulfhydrylase, which  catalyzes  the conversion of acetylhomoserine
   into homocysteine  and  that  of  acetylserine into cysteine (gene MET17 or
   MET25 in yeast).
 - O-succinylhomoserine sulfhydrylase (EC 4.2.99.-).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YGL184c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR112c.

These enzymes are proteins of about  400 amino-acid residues.  The pyridoxal-P

enzymes; the  sequence around this residue is highly conserved and can be used
as a signature pattern to detect this class of enzymes.

Glyoxalase I  (EC 4.4.1.5) (lactoylglutathione lyase) catalyzes the first step
of the  glyoxal  pathway,  the transformation of methylglyoxal and glutathione
into S-lactoylglutathione  which  is then converted by glyoxalase II to lactic
acid [1].  Glyoxalase I is  an  ubiquitous enzyme which binds one mole of zinc
per subunit. The bacterial and yeast enzymes are monomeric while the mammalian
one is homodimeric.

The sequence  of  glyoxalase I is well conserved. In bacteria and mammals, the
enzyme is  a  protein  of about 130 to 180 residues while in fungi it is about
twice longer. In these  organisms the enzyme is built out of the tandem repeat
of an homologous domain.

We have   derived  two  signature  patterns  for this family. The first one is
located in  the  N-terminal  region  while  the  second  one is located in the
central section  of  the protein and contains a conserved histidine that could
be implicated in the binding of the zinc atom.

Adenylate cyclase  (EC 4.6.1.1) is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of
cAMP from  ATP. From sequence  data, it has been proposed [1,2] that there are
three different  classes  of adenylate cyclases. Class I cyclases are found in
enterobacteria and related Gram-negative bacteria.  They are proteins of about
850 residues  that  consist  of two functional domains: a N-terminal catalytic
domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain.

As signature  patterns we selected two highly conserved regions, the first one
is located  in  the  catalytic  domain  and  the  second one in the regulatory
domain. The  second  signature  includes  a conserved histidine which could be
phosphorylated  by a PTS system IIA  enzyme, thus leading to the activation of

* Guanylate cyclases signature and profile *
********************************************

Guanylate cyclases (EC 4.6.1.2) [1 to 4] catalyze the formation  of cyclic GMP
(cGMP) from GTP.  cGMP  acts as an  intracellular  messenger, activating cGMP-
dependent kinases and regulating CGMP-sensitive ion channels. The role of cGMP
as a second messenger in vascular smooth muscle relaxation  and retinal photo-
transduction  is  well  established.  Guanylate  cyclase is  found both in the
soluble and particular fraction  of eukaryotic cells.  The soluble  and plasma
membrane-bound forms differ in structure, regulation and other properties.

Most currently  known  plasma  membrane-bound  forms  are  receptors for small
polypeptides.  The topology of such proteins is the following:  they have a N-
terminal extracellular domain which acts as the ligand binding region, then  a
transmembrane domain, followed by  a  large cytoplasmic C-terminal region that
can be subdivided into  two domains: a protein kinase-like domain that appears
important for proper signalling and a cyclase  catalytic domain. This topology
is schematically represented below.

   +-----------------------xxxxx----------------------+---------------+
   | Ligand-binding        XXXXX  Protein Kinase like |   Cyclase     |
   +-----------------------xxxxx----------------------+---------------+
     Extracellular         Transmembrane          Cytoplasmic

The known guanylate cyclase receptors are:

 - The sea-urchins receptors for  speract and resact, which are small peptides
   that stimulate sperm motility and metabolism.
 - The receptors for natriuretic peptides (ANF).  Two  forms  of ANF receptors
   with guanylate cyclase activity are  currently known: GC-A (or ANP-A) which
   seems specific  to  atrial  natriuretic peptide (ANP), and GC-B  (or ANP-B)
   which seems to be stimulated  more effectively by brain natriuretic peptide
   (BNP) than by ANP.
 - The receptor for  Escherichia  coli  heat-stable  enterotoxin (GC-C).   The
   endogenous ligand for this intestinal receptor seems to be a  small peptide
   called guanylin.
 - Retinal   guanylate   cyclase  (retGC)  which  probably  plays  a  specific
   functional role in the rods and/or cones of photoreceptors. It is not known
   if this protein acts as receptor,  but  its structure is similar to that of
   the other plasma membrane-bound GCs.

The soluble forms of guanylate cyclase are  cytoplasmic heterodimers.  The two
subunits, alpha and beta are  proteins of  from 70 to 82 Kd  which are  highly
related. Two forms of beta subunits are currently known: beta-1 which seems to
be expressed in  lung and brain,  and beta-2  which is more abundant in kidney
and liver.

The membrane and  cytoplasmic  forms  of  guanylate  cyclase share a conserved
domain which is probably important  for  the catalytic activity of the enzyme.
Such  a domain  is also  found  twice in the different forms of membrane-bound
adenylate cyclases (also known as class-III) [5,6] from mammals, slime mold or
Drosophila. We have derived a consensus pattern from the most conserved region
in that domain. We also developed a profile which covers the domain.

**********************************

Chorismate synthase (EC 4.6.1.4) catalyzes  the last of the seven steps in the
shikimate pathway  which  is  used  in  prokaryotes, fungi and  plants for the
biosynthesis of  aromatic  amino acids. It catalyzes the 1,4-trans elimination
of the  phosphate group from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to form
chorismate which  can  then  be  used in phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan
biosynthesis. Chorismate  synthase  requires  the presence of a reduced flavin
mononucleotide (FMNH2 or FADH2) for its activity.

Chorismate synthase from various sources shows [1,2] a high degree of sequence
conservation. It  is  a  protein  of  about 360 to 400 amino-acid residues. We
developed three  signature  patterns  from  conserved  regions  rich  in basic
residues (mostly  arginines).  The  first  is  in  the N-terminal section, the
second is central and the third is C-terminal.

6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase  (EC 4.6.1.10) (PTPS) [1]  catalyzes  the
second step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  tetrahydrobiopterin  (BH4);  a complex
rearrangement of    7,8-dihydroneopterin    triphosphate    into    6-pyruvoyl
tetrahydropterin.

PTPS is  a  small  protein  of  about 145 residues  and forms a homooligomeric
complex of  two  trimers  assembled  in  a  head-to-head  fashion.  It binds a
magnesium atom  which  is  ligated by three histidine residues. Three residues
are implicated  in  the  catalytic  mechanism:  a  cysteine, a histidine and a
glutamate.

We developed  two  signature  patterns for PTPS. The first contains the active
site cysteine  and  two  of the three magnesium ligands.  The second signature
contains the active site histidine.

* Ferrochelatase signature *
****************************

Ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) (protoheme ferro-lyase) [1,2] catalyzes the  last
step in  heme  biosynthesis: the chelation of a ferrous ion to proto-porphyrin
IX, to form protoheme.

In eukaryotes,  ferrochelatase  is  a mitochondrial protein bound to the inner
membrane, whose active site faces the mitochondrial matrix. The mature form of
eukaryotic ferrochelatase  is  composed of about 360 amino acids. In bacteria,
ferrochelatase (gene hemH) [3] is a protein of from 310 to 380 amino acids.

The human autosomal  dominant  disease  protoporphyria  is  due to the reduced
activity of ferrochelatase.

The signature pattern for this enzyme is  based  on a conserved  region  which
contains a histidine residue which could be involved in binding iron.

Alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1) [1] catalyzes the pyridoxal-dependent conversion
of L-alanine into D-alanine, a key building block  of bacterial peptidoglycan.
In bacteria such as Escherichia coli or  Salmonella typhimurium, there are two
forms of  alanine  racemase:  a biosynthetic form (alr) required for cell wall
formation  and a  form  (dadB)  that  functions  in  L-alanine  catabolism. In
contrast to  dadB and alr which are monomeric enzymes, the alanine racemase of
Bacillaceae are   homodimers.   In  Pseudomonas  putida,  there  is  a  broad-
specificity amino acid racemase which is functionally and structurally related
to alanine racemase.

The pyridoxal-phosphate group of  alanine racemase  is  attached  to  a lysine
residue.  The sequence around this residue is highly conserved in all forms of
the enzyme.

Aspartate racemase (EC 5.1.1.13)  and  glutamate racemase (EC 5.1.1.3) are two
evolutionary related bacterial enzymes  that do not seem to require a cofactor
for their activity [1].  Glutamate  racemase,  which interconverts L-glutamate
into D-glutamate,  is  required for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan and some
peptide-based antibiotics such as gramicidin S.

In addition  to  characterized  aspartate and glutamate racemases, this family
also includes  a  hypothetical  protein  from  Erwinia carotovora and one from
Escherichia coli (ygeA).

Two conserved cysteines are present in the sequence of these enzymes. They are
expected to  play  a  role  in catalytic activity by acting as bases in proton
abstraction from  the  substrate.  We  developed  signature  patterns for both
cysteines.

Mandelate racemase   (EC 5.1.2.2)   (MR)  and   muconate  lactonizing   enzyme
(EC 5.5.1.1)  (MLE)  are  two  bacterial  enzymes  involved  in  aromatic acid
catabolism. They  catalyze  mechanistically  distinct  reactions  yet they are
related at  the  level of their primary, quaternary (homooctamer) and tertiary
structures [1,2].

A number  of  other proteins also seem to be evolutionary related to these two
enzymes. These are:

 - The various plasmid-encoded chloromuconate cycloisomerases (EC 5.5.1.7).
 - Escherichia  coli  protein  rspA  [3],  rspA  seems  to  be involved in the
   degradation of homoserine lactone (HSL) or of one of its metabolite.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycjG.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydaW.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yidU.
 - A hypothetical protein from Streptomyces ambofaciens [4].

We developed two signature patterns for these enzymes;  both contain conserved

which are  ligands  for  either a magnesium ion (in MR) or a manganese ion (in
MLE).

Ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.1) (also known as pentose-5-phosphate
3-epimerase or PPE) is  the enzyme  that  converts D-ribulose 5-phosphate into
D-xylulose 5-phosphate in  Calvin's  reductive  pentose  phosphate  cycle.  In
Alcaligenes eutrophus    two  copies of the gene coding for PPE are known [1],

PPE has  been  found  in  a  wide  range of bacteria, archebacteria, fungi and
plants. The sequence of PPE is highly related to:

 - Escherichia coli D-allulose-6-phosphate 3-epimerase (gene alsE).
 - Escherichia coli protein sgcE.

All these proteins have from 209 to 241 amino acid residues.

As signature patterns, we selected two  conserved regions which are located in
respectively in the N-terminal and in the central part of these proteins.

****************************************************************************

Cyclophilin [1] is  the  major high-affinity  binding  protein  in vertebrates
for  the immunosuppressive  drug  cyclosporin A (CSA). It exhibits a peptidyl-
prolyl cis-trans  isomerase activity (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase
is an  enzyme  that  accelerates protein folding by catalyzing  the  cis-trans
isomerization  of proline    imidic  peptide bonds in oligopeptides [2]. It is
probable that  CSA  mediates  some  of its effects via an inhibitory action on
PPIase.  Cyclophilin  is a cytosolic protein which belongs to a family [3,4,5]
that also includes the following isozymes:

 - Cyclophilin B  (or S-cyclophilin),  a  PPIase   which  is  retained  in  an
   endoplasmic reticulum compartment.
 - Cyclophilin C, a cytoplasmic PPiase.
 - Mitochondrial matrix cyclophilin (cyp3).
 - A  PPIase  which  seems  specific  for  the  folding of rhodopsin and is an
   integral membrane  protein  anchored  by a C-terminal transmembrane region.
   This protein was first characterized in Drosophila (gene ninaA).
 - Bacterial periplasmic PPiase (gene ppiA).
 - Bacterial cytosolic PPiase (gene ppiB).
 - Natural-killer cell  cyclophilin-related protein. This large protein (about
   160 Kd) is a component of a putative tumor-recognition  complex involved in
   the function of NK cells. It contains a cyclophilin-type PPiase domain.
 - Mammalian  nucleoporin Nup358 [6], a nuclear pore complex protein of 358 Kd
   that contains a C-terminal cyclophilin-type PPiase domain.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJR032w.
 - Fission yeast hypothetical protein SpAC21E11.05c.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T27D1.1.

The sequences of  the  different  forms  of cyclophilin-type  PPIases are well

central part of these enzymes.

FKBP [1,2,3]  is  the major high-affinity binding protein, in vertebrates, for
the immunosuppressive    drug  FK506.  It  exhibits  peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase activity (EC 5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase is an enzyme that
accelerates protein  folding  by  catalyzing  the   cis-trans isomerization of
proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides [4].

At least three different forms of FKBP are known in mammalian species:

 - FKBP-12, which is cytosolic and inhibited by both FK506 and rapamycin.
 - FKBP-13,  which  is  membrane  associated  and  inhibited by both FK506 and
   rapamycin.
 - FKBP-25, which is preferentially inhibited by rapamycin.

These forms  of  FKBP are evolutionary related and show extensive similarities
[5,6,7] with the following proteins:

 - Fungal FKBP.
 - Mammalian  hsp  binding  immunophilin  (HBI)  (also  called  p59). HBI is a
   protein which  binds  to hsp90 and contains two FKBP-like domains in its N-
   terminal section - the first of which seems to be functional.
 - The C-terminal  part  of  the  cell-surface  protein  mip  from Legionella;
   a protein associated with macrophage infection by an unknown mechanism.
 - Escherichia coli slyD [8], a protein with a N-terminal FKBP domain followed
   by an histidine-rich metal-binding domain.
 - Escherichia coli fkpA.
 - Escherichia coli fklB (FKBP22).
 - Escherichia coli slpA.
 - Bacterial trigger factor (Tig).
 - Streptomyces hygroscopus and chrysomallus FK506-binding protein.
 - Chlamydia trachomatis 27 Kd membrane protein.
 - Neisseria meningitidis strain C114 PPiase.
 - Probable    PPiases  from  Haemophilus  influenzae  (HI0754), Methanococcus
   jannaschii (MJ0278  and  MJ0825),  Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonase
   aeruginosa.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for  these proteins. One is based on a
conserved region  in  the  N-terminus  of  FKBP,  the  other is located in the
central section. The profile for FKBP spans the complete domain.

Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans  isomerase  (EC  5.2.1.8) (PPIase or rotamase) is an
enzyme that   accelerates   protein   folding   by  catalyzing  the  cis-trans
isomerization of  proline  imidic  peptide  bonds  in  oligopeptides [1]. Most
characterized PPiases  belong  to  two  families,  the  cyclophilin-type  (see
<PDOC00154>) and the the FKBP-type (see <PDOC00426>).  Recently a third family
has been  discovered  [2,3].  So  far,  the  only  biochemically characterized
member of  this family is the Escherichia coli protein parvulin (gene ppiC), a
small (92  residues) cytoplasmic  enzyme that prefers amino acid residues with
hydrophobic side  chains  like leucine and phenylalanine in the P1 position of
the peptides  substrates. PpiC is evolutionary related to a number of proteins
that are also probably PPiases:

 - Escherichia  coli  and  Haemophilus influenzae ppiD. PpiD is a PPIase which
   contains a  periplasmic ppiC-like domain anchored to the inner membrane and
   which seems to be involved in the folding of outer membrane proteins.
 - Escherichia  coli  surA.  SurA  is  a periplasmic protein that contains two
   ppiC-like domains.
 - Nitrogen-assimilating  bacteria  protein  nifM  which  is  involved  in the
   activation and stabilization of the iron-component (nifH) of nitrogenase.
 - Bacillus  subtilis  protein  prsA, a membrane-bound lipoprotein involved in
   protein export.
 - Lactococcus and lactobacillus protease maturation protein prtM, a membrane-
   bound lipoprotein   involved   in  the  maturation  of  a  secreted  serine
   proteinase.
 - Yeast protein ESS1/PTF1 (processing/termination factor 1).
 - Drosophila protein dodo (gene dod).
 - Mammalian protein PIN1,
 - Campylobacter jejuni cell binding factor 2 (CBF2), a secreted antigen.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yacD.
 - Helicobacter pylori hypothetical protein HP0175.
 - A hypothetical slime mold protein.

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region that contains a serine
which could  play  a role in the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. We also
developed a profile that spans the complete ppiC domain.

Triosephosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.1) (TIM) [1] is the glycolytic enzyme that
catalyzes  the  reversible  interconversion  of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  TIM plays an important role  in several metabolic
pathways and  is  essential  for efficient energy production. It is a dimer of
identical subunits, each of which is made up of about 250 amino-acid residues.
A glutamic  acid  residue  is  involved  in  the  catalytic mechanism [2]. The

Xylose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.5) [1] is an  enzyme  found in microorganisms which
catalyzes the interconversion of D-xylose to D-xylulose. It can also isomerize
D-ribose to D-ribulose and D-glucose to D-fructose.  Xylose isomerase seems to
require magnesium for its activity, while cobalt is necessary to stabilize the
tetrameric structure of the enzyme.  A number of residues are conserved in all
known xylose isomerases.

Xylose isomerase  also  exists  in  plants  [2] where it is homodimeric and is
manganese-dependent.

We developed  two signatures  patterns for xylose isomerase.  The first one is
derived from a stretch of five conserved amino acids that includes a  glutamic
acid residue known to be one of the  four  residues involved in the binding of
the magnesium ion [3]; this  pattern also  includes a  lysine residue which is
involved in the catalytic activity.       The second pattern is derived from a
conserved region  in the N-terminal  section  of  the  enzyme  that include an
histidine  residue which  has  been shown [4]  to be involved in the catalytic
mechanism of the enzyme.

Phosphomannose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.8) (PMI) [1,2] is the enzyme that catalyzes
the interconversion   of   mannose-6-phosphate  and  fructose-6-phosphate.  In
eukaryotes, it is  involved  in  the  synthesis  of     GDP-mannose which is a
constituent of N- and O-linked glycans as well as GPI anchors. In prokaryotes,
it is  involved  in  a  variety  of pathways including capsular polysaccharide
biosynthesis and D-mannose metabolism.

Three classes  of  PMI have been defined on the basis of sequence similarities
[1]. The first  class comprises all known eukaryotic PMI as well as the enzyme
encoded by  the  manA gene in enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. Class I
PMI's are  proteins  of about  42 to 50 Kd which bind a zinc ion essential for
their activity.

As signature patterns  for class I PMI, we selected two conserved regions. The
first one  is  located in the N-terminal section of these proteins, the second
in the  C-terminal  half.  Both patterns contain a residue involved [3] in the
binding of the zinc ion.

Phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) (PGI) [1,2] is  a  dimeric  enzyme  that
catalyzes the reversible isomerization  of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-
phosphate. PGI is involved in different pathways: in  most higher organisms it
is involved in glycolysis; in mammals  it  is  involved in gluconeogenesis; in
plants in carbohydrate biosynthesis; in some  bacteria  it  provides a gateway
for fructose into the Entner-Doudouroff pathway.  PGI has been shown [3] to be
identical to neuroleukin, a neurotrophic factor which supports the survival of
various types of neurons.

The sequence of PGI  from many species  ranging from  bacteria  to  mammals is
available and has been shown to be highly conserved. As signature patterns for
this enzyme we selected two conserved regions,  the first region is located in
the central section of PGI, while  the second one is located in its C-terminal
section.

Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (EC 5.3.1.10) (or Glc-6-P deaminase) is  the

Glc-6-P isomerase  is evolutionary related to:

   [2].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yieK.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ybfT.

As a  signature  pattern we selected a conserved region located in the central

* Phosphoglycerate mutase family phosphohistidine signature *
*************************************************************

Phosphoglycerate  mutase (EC 5.4.2.1) (PGAM)  and  bisphosphoglycerate  mutase
(EC 5.4.2.4) (BPGM) are structurally  related enzymes which catalyze reactions
involving the  transfer  of  phospho groups between the  three carbon atoms of
phosphoglycerate [1,2].   Both enzymes can catalyze three different reactions,
although in different proportions:

 - The isomerization of  2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA)  to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-
   PGA) with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) as the primer of the reaction.
 - The synthesis of 2,3-DPG from 1,3-DPG with 3-PGA as a primer.
 - The degradation of 2,3-DPG to 3-PGA (phosphatase EC 3.1.3.13 activity).

In mammals, PGAM is a dimeric protein. There  are  two isoforms of PGAM: the M
(muscle) and B (brain) forms. In yeast, PGAM is a tetrameric protein.  BPGM is
a dimeric protein and is found mainly in erythrocytes where it  plays  a major
role in regulating hemoglobin oxygen  affinity as a consequence of controlling
2,3-DPG concentration.

The catalytic  mechanism of both PGAM and  BPGM  involves  the  formation of a
phosphohistidine intermediate [3].

The bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase / fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
(EC 2.7.1.105 and EC 3.1.3.46) (PF2K) [4] catalyzes both the synthesis and the
degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. PF2K is an important  enzyme  in the
regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.  Like  PGAM/BPGM, the fructose-
2,6-bisphosphatase  reaction  involves a phosphohistidine intermediate and the
phosphatase domain of PF2K is structurally related to PGAM/BPGM.

The bacterial enzyme alpha-ribazole-5'-phosphate phosphatase (gene cobC) which
is involved in cobalamin biosynthesis also belongs to this family [5].

We built a signature pattern around the phosphohistidine residue.

 enzyme is not related to the family described above [6].

   the conversion  of  D-glucose 1-phosphate into  D-glucose 6-phosphate.  PGM
   participates in both the breakdown and synthesis of glucose [1].
 - Phosphomannomutase (EC 5.4.2.8) (PMM).  PMM  is  an enzyme  responsible for
   the conversion of D-mannose 1-phosphate into D-mannose 6-phosphate.  PMM is
   required for  different biosynthetic pathways in bacteria.  For example, in
   enterobacteria  such  as Escherichia coli  there  are  two  different genes
   coding for this  enzyme:  rfbK  which is involved in the synthesis of the O
   antigen of lipopolysaccharide and cpsG  which is required for the synthesis
   of the M antigen capsular polysaccharide [2]. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa PMM
   (gene algC) is  involved  in the biosynthesis of the alginate layer [3] and
   in Xanthomonas campestris (gene xanA) it is involved in the biosynthesis of
   xanthan [4].  In  Rhizobium strain ngr234 (gene noeK) it is involved in the
   biosynthesis of the nod factor.
 - Phosphoacetylglucosamine  mutase  (EC  5.4.2.3)  which converts N-acetyl-D-
   glucosamine 1-phosphate into the 6-phosphate isomer.

The  catalytic  mechanism  of  both  PGM  and  PMM involves the formation of a

Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase  (EC 5.4.99.2)  (MCM)  [1]  is  an  adenosylcobalamin
(vitamin B12)  dependent  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  isomerization  between
methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA.   MCM is  involved in various catabolic or
biosynthetic pathways; for example in man it is involved in the degradation of
several amino acids, odd-chain  fatty acids  and cholesterol via propionyl-CoA
to the tricarboxylic acid cycle; while in some bacteria it is involved  in the
synthesis of propionate from tricarboxylic acid-cycle intermediates.

Deficiency of MCM in  man  causes  an  often  fatal  disorder  of organic acid
metabolism termed methylmalonic acidemia.

In eukaryotes MCM is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is a homodimer of
a polypeptide  chain  of  about 710 amino acids. In bacteria MCM is a dimer of
two non-identical, yet structurally related chains.

The sequences  of  eukaryotic and prokaryotic MCM  are  rather well conserved.

As a signature pattern  we selected the best conserved region which is located

DNA topoisomerase  I  (EC  5.99.1.2)  [1,2,3,4,E1] is  one of the two types of
enzyme that  catalyze  the  interconversion of topological DNA isomers. Type I
topoisomerases act  by catalyzing the transient breakage of DNA, one strand at
a time,  and the subsequent rejoining of the strands. When a eukaryotic type 1
topoisomerase breaks a DNA backbone bond,  it  simultaneously forms a protein-
DNA link  where  the  hydroxyl  group of a tyrosine residue is joined to a 3'-
phosphate on  DNA,  at one end of the enzyme-severed DNA strand. In eukaryotes
and poxvirus topoisomerases I, there are a number of conserved residues in the
region around the active site tyrosine.

Prokaryotic organisms, such as Escherichia coli, have two type I topoisomerase
isozymes: topoisomerase  I  (gene  topA)  and  topoisomerase  III (gene topB).
Eukaroytes also contain homologs of prokaryotic topoisomerase III.

There are a  number of conserved residues in the region around the active site
tyrosine; we used this region as a signature pattern.

* DNA topoisomerase II signature *
**********************************

DNA topoisomerase  I  (EC  5.99.1.2)  [1,2,3,4,E1] is  one of the two types of
enzyme that catalyze  the  interconversion of topological DNA isomers. Type II
topoisomerases are  ATP-dependent  and act by passing a DNA  segment through a
transient double-strand   break.   Topoisomerase   II   is  found  in  phages,
archaebacteria, prokaryotes,  eukaryotes,  and  in  African  Swine Fever virus
(ASF). In  bacteriophage  T4  topoisomerase II consists of three subunits (the
product of  genes  39,  52  and  60). In prokaryotes and in archaebacteria the
enzyme, known  as  DNA  gyrase,  consists of two subunits (genes gyrA and gyrB
[E2]). In  some  bacteria, a second type II topoisomerase has been identified;
it is known as topoisomerase IV and is required for chromosome segregation, it
also consists  of  two  subunits (genes parC and parE). In eukaryotes, type II
topoisomerase is a homodimer.

There are many regions of sequence homology between the different  subtypes of
topoisomerase II. The relation between the different  subunits is shown in the
following representation:

<----------------About-1400-residues----------------------->

As a signature pattern for this family of proteins,  we have selected a region

Aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases (EC 6.1.1.-) [1] are  a  group  of  enzymes  which
activate amino acids and transfer them to specific tRNA molecules as the first
step in protein biosynthesis. In  prokaryotic organisms  there  are  at  least
twenty different types  of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases,  one for each different
amino acid. In eukaryotes  there are  generally two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
for  each  different amino  acid: one cytosolic form and a mitochondrial form.
While all these  enzymes have  a  common  function, they are widely diverse in
terms of subunit size and of quaternary structure.

A few years ago it was found [2] that several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases share
a  region  of  similarity in  their   N-terminal  section,  in  particular the
consensus tetrapeptide His-Ile-Gly-His ('HIGH') is  very  well  conserved. The
'HIGH' region has been shown [3] to be part of the adenylate binding site. The
'HIGH' signature has been found in the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific for
arginine, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine,
tyrosine,  tryptophan,  and   valine.  These  aminoacyl-tRNA  synthetases  are
referred to as class-I synthetases [4,5,6] and seem to share the same tertiary
structure based on a Rossmann fold.

A conserved domain of 46 amino  acids has been shown [1]  to exist in a number
of higher eukaryote aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetases. This domain is present
one to six times in the following enzymes:

 - Mammalian multifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is  present
   three  times in  a  region  that  separates  the  N-terminal  glutamyl-tRNA
   synthetase domain from the C-terminal prolyl-tRNA synthetase domain.
 - Drosophila multifunctional aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is present
   six times in the intercatalytic region.
 - Mammalian tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase.  The  domain  is  found  at  the N-
   terminal extremity.
 - Mammalian, insect, nematode and plant glycyl-tRNA synthetase. The domain is
   found at the N-terminal extremity [2].
 - Mammalian histidyl-tRNA synthetase.  The domain is found  at the N-terminal
   extremity.

This domain,  which  we  call  WHEP-TRS, could contain a central alpha-helical
region and  may  play  a  role  in  the  association  of tRNA-synthetases into
multienzyme complexes.

We developed a signature pattern based on the first 29  positions of the WHEP-
domain.

* ATP-citrate lyase / succinyl-CoA ligases signatures *
*******************************************************

Four different enzymes  share a similar catalytic mechanism which involves the
phosphorylation  by ATP (or GTP) of a specific histidine residue in the active
site. These enzymes are:

 - ATP citrate-lyase (EC 4.1.3.8) [1], the primary  enzyme responsible for the
   synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA  in many tissues, catalyzes the formation
   of acetyl-CoA  and oxaloacetate from citrate and CoA  with the  concomitant
   hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate.  ATP-citrate lyase is a tetramer of
   identical subunits.
 - Succinyl-CoA ligase  (GDP-forming)  (EC 6.2.1.4)  [2]  is  a  mitochondrial
   enzyme  that  catalyzes  the substrate  level  phosphorylation  step of the
   tricarboxylic acid cycle: the formation of succinyl-CoA from succinate with
   a concomitant  hydrolysis  of  GTP to GDP and phosphate.   This enzyme is a
   dimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunits.
 - Succinyl-CoA ligase (ADP-forming) (EC 6.2.1.5) [3]  is  a  bacterial enzyme
   that during aerobic metabolism functions in the citric acid cycle, coupling
   the  hydrolysis  of  succinyl-CoA to  the synthesis  of ATP.  It  can  also
   function in the  other  direction  for anabolic purposes.  This enzyme is a
   tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits.
 - Malate-CoA   ligase (EC 6.2.1.9) (malyl-CoA synthetase) [4], is a bacterial
   enzyme that  forms  malyl-CoA  from  malate  and  CoA  with the concomitant
   hydrolysis of   ATP  to ADP and phosphate. Malate-CoA ligase is composed of
   two different subunits.

We developed three signature patterns for these enzymes, the first corresponds
to a glycine-rich conserved region, located in the second half of ATP  citrate
lyase and in the alpha subunits of succinyl-CoA ligases and malate-CoA ligase.
The second pattern, which is located some 50 residues to the C-terminal of the
first one, includes the active site phosphorylated histidine residue. The last
pattern corresponds  to  a  conserved  region located in the first half of ATP
citrate lyase  and in the beta subunits of succinyl-CoA ligases and malate-CoA
ligase.

* Glutamine synthetase signatures *
***********************************

Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) (GS)  [1] plays  an  essential  role  in the
metabolism of nitrogen by catalyzing the condensation of glutamate and ammonia
to form glutamine.

There seem to be three different classes of GS [2,3,4]:

 - Class I enzymes (GSI) are specific to prokaryotes, and are  oligomers of 12
   identical subunits.  The  activity  of GSI-type enzyme is controlled by the
   adenylation of a tyrosine residue. The adenylated enzyme is inactive.
 - Class II enzymes (GSII) are  found in  eukaryotes and in bacteria belonging
   to the Rhizobiaceae,  Frankiaceae,  and  Streptomycetaceae  families (these
   bacteria have  also a class-I GS). GSII are octamer  of identical subunits.
   Plants have  two  or  more  isozymes  of  GSII,  one  of  the  isozymes  is
   translocated into the chloroplast.
 - Class III enzymes (GSIII) has, currently,  only  been  found in Bacteroides
   fragilis and  in  butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens.  It is a hexamer of identical
   chains. It is much larger (about 700 amino acids) than the  GSI (450 to 470
   amino acids) or GSII (350 to 420 amino acids) enzymes.

While the three classes of GS's are clearly structurally related, the sequence
similarities are not so extensive.    As signature  patterns we selected three
conserved regions.   The first pattern is based on a conserved tetrapeptide in
the N-terminal  section of  the enzyme,  the second one is based on a glycine-
rich region which is thought to be involved in ATP-binding.  The third pattern
is specific to class I glutamine synthetases and includes the tyrosine residue
which is reversibly adenylated.

* D-alanine--D-alanine ligase signatures *
******************************************

D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (EC 6.3.2.4) is  a  bacterial  enzyme  involved in
cell-wall biosynthesis.   It   participates   in  forming  UDP-N-acetylmuramyl
pentapeptide, the peptidoglycan precursor.

In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, there are two different D-ala--D-ala
ligase  isozymes (genes  ddlA  and ddlB) [1].  In Enterobacterium faecium  and
gallinarum, genes  vanA  and  vanC  encode  D-ala--D-ala  ligases  of  altered
specificity, which  catalyze  ester  bond formations between D-ala and various
D-hydroxy acids   [2].  They  are  required  for  resistance  to  glycopeptide
antibiotics, such  as  vancomycin  which  inhibits  late  stages  in cell-wall
synthesis.

These enzymes  are  proteins of      300  to 360 amino acids.  There  are many
conserved regions, of  which  we selected two as signature patterns. The first
pattern, which  is  Gly-rich  and could be involved in ATP-binding, is located
near the N-terminal extremity, the second is in the C-terminal section.

pathway; the ATP-dependent conversion of 5'-phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-
carboxylic acid  and  aspartic  acid  to  SAICAR [1]. In bacteria (gene purC),
fungi (gene  ADE1)  and plants, SAICAR synthetase is a monofunctional protein;
in higher  vertebrates  it  is the N-terminal domain  of a bifunctional enzyme
that also catalyze phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase (AIRC) activity.

As signature patterns for SAICAR synthetase, we selected two conserved regions
in the central section of this enzyme.

* Ubiquitin-activating enzyme signatures *
******************************************

Ubiquitin-activating  enzyme  (E1 enzyme) [1,2] activates ubiquitin  by  first
adenylating with ATP its C-terminal  glycine  residue  and  thereafter linking
this residue to  the  side  chain  of  a  cysteine  residue in E1, yielding an
ubiquitin-E1   thiolester  and  free  AMP.   Later  the  ubiquitin  moiety  is
transferred to a  cysteine  residue on  one  of  the  many forms of ubiquitin-
conjugating enzymes (E2).

E1 is  a large monomeric protein of about 110 to 115 Kd (about 1000 residues).
In yeast  there are two forms (UBA1 and UBA2) [3], while in plants and mammals
multiple forms  exist  including  a  form  which is Y-linked in mouse and some
other mammals and which may be involved in spermatogenesis.

It has been shown [4] that  the  last of the five cysteines that are conserved
in the sequence of E1 from various species is the one that binds ubiquitin. We
have developed  two  patterns  specific for E1, the first pattern contains the
second of  the  five conserved cysteines while the second pattern includes the
active site cysteine.

Ubiquitin-conjugating  enzymes  (EC 6.3.2.19)   (UBC  or  E2 enzymes)  [1,2,3]
catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins. An activated
ubiquitin moiety is transferred from an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) to E2
which later ligates ubiquitin  directly  to substrate proteins with or without
the assistance of 'N-end' recognizing proteins (E3).

In most species there are  many forms  of UBC  (at least 9 in yeast) which are
implicated in diverse cellular functions.

A cysteine residue is  required for ubiquitin-thiolester formation. There is a
single conserved  cysteine in UBC's and  the  region  around  that  residue is
conserved in the sequence of known UBC isozymes.   We have used that region as
a signature  pattern.  We  also  developed  a  profile that spans the complete

***********************************************

Formate--tetrahydrofolate    ligase   (EC 6.3.4.3)     (formyltetrahydrofolate
synthetase) (FTHFS)  is  one of the enzymes  participating  in the transfer of
one-carbon units, an  essential element of various biosynthetic pathways.   In
many of these processes the transfers of  one-carbon units are mediated by the
coenzyme   tetrahydrofolate  (THF).   Various  reactions  generate  one-carbon
derivatives of THF  which can be  interconverted  between  different oxidation
states  by  FTHFS,  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.5.1.5)  and
methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.9).

In eukaryotes  the  FTHFS  activity  is expressed by a multifunctional enzyme,
C-1-tetrahydrofolate  synthase (C1-THF synthase),  which  also  catalyzes  the
dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities. Two forms of C1-THF synthases are
known [1],  one  is located in the mitochondrial  matrix, while the second one
is cytoplasmic.  In  both forms  the FTHFS domain  consist of  about 600 amino
acid residues  and is located in the C-terminal section of C1-THF synthase. In
prokaryotes FTHFS  activity is  expressed by  a  monofunctional homotetrameric
enzyme of about 560 amino acid residues [2].

The sequence of FTHFS  is  highly conserved  in  all  forms of the enzyme.  As
signature  patterns  we  selected  two  regions  that   are  almost  perfectly
conserved. The first one is a  glycine-rich segment located  in the N-terminal
part of FTHFS and which could be part of an ATP-binding domain [2]. The second
pattern is located in the central section of FTHFS.

AS is  a  homotetrameric enzyme of chains of about 400 amino-acid residues. An
arginine seems to be important for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.

The sequences of AS  from various prokaryotes, archaebacteria  and  eukaryotes

* Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase subdomain signatures *
*****************************************************

Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase (CPSase) catalyzes the ATP-dependent synthesis of
carbamyl-phosphate from  glutamine  (EC  6.3.5.5) or ammonia (EC 6.3.4.16) and
bicarbonate [1].   This important enzyme initiates both the urea cycle and the
biosynthesis of arginine and pyrimidines.

Glutamine-dependent CPSase  (CPSase  II)  is  involved  in the biosynthesis of
pyrimidines and purines. In bacteria such as Escherichia coli, a single enzyme
is involved  in  both biosynthetic pathways while other bacteria have separate
enzymes. The bacterial enzymes are formed of two subunits. A small chain (gene
carA) that provides glutamine amidotransferase activity (GATase) necessary for
removal of  the  ammonia  group  from glutamine, and a large chain (gene carB)
that provides  CPSase  activity. Such a structure is also present in fungi for
arginine biosynthesis  (genes  CPA1  and CPA2). In most  eukaryotes, the first
three steps   of   pyrimidine   biosynthesis   are   catalyzed   by   a  large
multifunctional enzyme  -  called URA2 in yeast, rudimentary in Drosophila and
CAD in  mammals [2]. The CPSase domain is located between an N-terminal GATase
domain and   the  C-terminal  part  which  encompass  the  dihydroorotase  and
aspartate transcarbamylase activities.

Ammonia-dependent CPSase (CPSase I) is involved in the urea cycle in ureolytic
vertebrates; it  is  a  monofunctional  protein  located  in the mitochondrial
matrix.

The CPSase  domain  is  typically  120  Kd  in  size  and  has arisen from the
duplication of an ancestral subdomain of about 500 amino acids. Each subdomain
independently binds to  ATP and it is suggested that the two homologous halves
act separately, one  to catalyze the phosphorylation of bicarbonate to carboxy
phosphate and the other that of carbamate to carbamyl phosphate.

The CPSase  subdomain is also present in a single copy in the biotin-dependent
enzymes acetyl-CoA  carboxylase  (EC 6.4.1.2) (ACC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase
(EC 6.4.1.3)  (PCCase),  pyruvate  carboxylase  (EC  6.4.1.1)  (PC)  and  urea
carboxylase (EC 6.3.4.6).

As signatures for  the  subdomain, we selected two conserved regions which are
probably important for binding ATP and/or catalytic activity.

During the  first  step of the joining reaction, the ligase interacts with ATP
to form  a  covalent enzyme-adenylate intermediate. A conserved lysine residue

Apart from the active  site  region,  the  only conserved region common to all

a conserved glutamate as well as four positions with conserved basic residues.

We developed signature patterns for both conserved regions.

* RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase signature *

RNA 3'-terminal  phosphate cyclase (EC 6.5.1.4) [1,2] catalyzes the conversion
of 3'-phosphate  to  a  2',3'-cyclic  phosphodiester  at  the  end of RNA. The
biological role of this enzyme is unknown but it is likely to function in some
aspects of cellular RNA processing.

The reaction catalyzed by the enzyme occurs in three steps:

 1) adenylation of the enzyme by ATP;
 2) the  enzyme  acts  on  RNA-3'terminal  phosphate to produce RNA-3'terminal
    diphosphate adenylate;
 3) Release  of  AMP and cyclisation by a non catalytic nucleophilic attack by
    the adjacent 2'hydroxyl on the phosphorus in the diester linkage.

This enzyme, which has been characterized in human (where there seems to be at
least three   isozymes)   and  Escherichia  coli  (gene  rtCA),  seems  to  be
taxonomically widespread.  It is found in insects, plants, fungi (gene RTC1 in
yeast) and in archeabacteria.

RNA cyclase is a protein of from 36 to 42 Kd. The best conserved region, which
we use as a signature pattern, is a glycine-rich strech of residues located in
the central  part of the sequence and which is reminiscent of various ATP, GTP
or AMP  glycine-rich  loops.  In  this  context, the conserved Arg (His in the
E.coli enzyme) could be the AMP-binding residue.

Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase  subunit  (EC  6.3.5.-) [1] is a microbial
enzyme that furnishes a means for formation of correctly charged Gln-tRNA(Gln)
through the  transamidation  of  misacylated  Glu-tRNA(Gln) in organisms which
lack glutaminyl-tRNA  synthetase.  The reaction takes place in the presence of
glutamine and ATP through an activated gamma-phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln). The enzyme
is composed  of  three  subunits:  A  (an amidase), B and C. It also exists in
eukaryotes as a protein targeted to the mitochondria.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  conserved region located in the N-

* Isopenicillin N synthetase signatures *
*****************************************

Isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS) [1,2] is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of
penicillin and cephalosporin.  In the presence of oxygen, it removes  iron and
ascorbate, four hydrogen atoms from L-(alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-d-valine
to form the azetidinone  and  thiazolidine rings of isopenicillin.  IPNS is an
enzyme of about 330 amino-acid residues. Two cysteines are conserved in fungal
and bacterial  IPNS  sequences;  these  may be involved in iron-binding and/or
substrate-binding.

Cephalosporium acremonium DAOCS/DACS [3] is a bifunctional  enzyme involved in
cephalosporin biosynthesis. The DAOCS domain, which is structurally related to
IPNS, catalyzes the step from penicillin N to deacetoxy-cephalosporin C - used
as a   substrate   by  DACS  to  form  deacetylcephalosporin  C.  Streptomyces
clavuligerus possesses  a  monofunctional  DAOCS  enzyme  (gene cefE) [4] also
related to IPNS.

We derived  two  signature  patterns  for  these  enzymes, centered around the
conserved cysteine residues.

* Site-specific recombinases signatures *
*****************************************

Site-specific recombination  plays  an  important role in DNA rearrangement in
prokaryotic organisms.  Two types  of site-specific recombination are known to
occur:

 - Recombination between  inverted repeats  resulting in the reversal of a DNA
   segment.
 - Recombination  between  repeat  sequences on two DNA molecules resulting in
   their cointegration,  or  between  repeats on one DNA molecule resulting in
   the excision of a DNA fragment.

Site-specific recombination  is  characterized by  a strand exchange mechanism
that requires no DNA synthesis or  high  energy  cofactor;  the phosphodiester
bond  energy  is conserved in a phospho-protein linkage during strand cleavage
and re-ligation.

Two unrelated  families  of  recombinases  are currently known [1]. The first,
called the `phage integrase' family,  groups  a number of bacterial, phage and
yeast plasmid enzymes.  The second [2],  called the `resolvase' family, groups
enzymes  which share the following  structural  characteristics: an N-terminal
catalytic and  dimerization domain that contains  a conserved   serine residue
involved in  the transient covalent attachment to DNA, and a C-terminal helix-
turn-helix DNA-binding domain.

The resolvase family is currently known to include the following proteins:

 - DNA invertase from Salmonella typhimurium (gene hin).  Hin can invert a 900
   bp DNA fragment adjacent to a gene for one of the flagellar antigens.
 - DNA invertase from Escherichia coli (gene pin).
 - DNA invertase from Bacteriophage Mu (gene gin), P1 and P7 (gene cin).
 - Resolvases from transposons Tn3, Tn21, Tn501, Tn552, Tn917, Tn1546, Tn1721,
   Tn2501 and Tn1000 (known as gamma-delta resolvase).
 - Resolvase from Clostridium perfringens plasmid pIP404.
 - Resolvase from Escherichia coli plasmid R46.
 - Resolvase from Escherichia coli plasmid RP4 (gene parA).
 - A putative recombinase from  Bacillus subtilis (gene cisA) [3] which  plays
   an important role in sporulation by  catalyzing the  recombination of genes
   spoIIIC and spoIVCB to form polymerase sigma-K factor.
 - Uvp1, a protein from Escherichia coli plasmid pR  which cooperates with the
   mucAB genes in the DNA repair process and could be a resolvase [4].

Generally, proteins  from  the  resolvase  family  have  180 to 200 amino-acid
residues, excepting cisA which is much larger (500 residues).

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for the resolvase family. The first is
based on  a  highly  conserved region  in  the  N-terminal  extremity of these
proteins; it  contains  a  serine  residue  most probably involved in covalent
attachment to  DNA.  The second pattern is based on a conserved region located
about 50 residues upstream of the serine active site.

* 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases acyltransferase component lipoyl binding site *
***************************************************************************

The 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase  multienzyme complexes [1,2]  from  bacterial and
eukaryotic sources  catalyze  the  oxidative decarboxylation of 2-oxo acids to
the corresponding acyl-CoA.   The three members  of this family of multienzyme
complexes are:

 - Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC).
 - 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC).
 - Branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex (BCOADC).

These three  complexes  share  a  common  architecture:   they are composed of
multiple copies  of three component enzymes - E1, E2 and E3.  E1 is a thiamine
pyrophosphate-dependent  2-oxo  acid  dehydrogenase,  E2     a dihydrolipamide
acyltransferase, and E3 an FAD-containing dihydrolipamide dehydrogenase.

E2 acyltransferases   have  an  essential  cofactor,  lipoic  acid,  which  is
covalently bound  via  a amide linkage to a lysine group. The E2 components of
OGCD and BCOACD bind a single lipoyl group, while those of PDC bind either one
(in yeast  and in Bacillus), two (in mammals), or three (in Azotobacter and in
Escherichia coli) lipoyl groups [3].

In addition to  the E2 components of the three  enzymatic  complexes described
above, a lipoic acid cofactor is also found in the following proteins:

 - H-protein of the  glycine cleavage system (GCS) [4]. GCS  is  a multienzyme
   complex of  four  protein  components,  which  catalyzes the degradation of
   glycine. H  protein  shuttles  the  methylamine group of glycine from the P
   protein to  the  T protein. H-protein from either prokaryotes or eukaryotes
   binds a single lipoic group.
 - Mammalian and  yeast  pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes differ  from that of
   other sources, in that they contain, in small amounts, a protein of unknown
   function -  designated  protein  X  or component X. Its sequence is closely
   related to that of E2 subunits and seems to bind a lipoic group [5].
 - Fast migrating protein (FMP) (gene acoC)  from  Alcaligenes  eutrophus [6].
   This protein is most probably a dihydrolipamide acyltransferase involved in
   acetoin metabolism.

We developed  a  signature  pattern  which allows the detection of the lipoyl-
binding site.

   ACV from the constituent amino acids.  The amino acids seem to be activated
   by adenylation.  It  is  a protein of around 3700 amino acids that contains
   three related domains of about 1000 amino acids.

   consists of four related domains.

There are also some proteins, whose exact function is not yet known, but which
are, very probably, also AMP-binding enzymes. These proteins are:

 - ORA  (octapeptide-repeat antigen),  a Plasmodium falciparum  protein  whose
   function is not known but which  shows a high degree of similarity with the
   above proteins.
 - AngR, a Vibrio anguillarum protein. AngR is thought to be a transcriptional
   activator  which  modulates  the  anguibactin (an iron-binding siderophore)
   biosynthesis gene  cluster operon.  But  we believe [9], that angR is not a
   DNA-binding protein, but rather an  enzyme involved in  the biosynthesis of
   anguibactin.  This conclusion is  based on three facts: the presence of the
   AMP-binding domain; the size of angR (1048 residues),  which is far  bigger
   than any bacterial transcriptional protein; and  the presence of a probable
   S-acyl thioesterase immediately downstream of angR.
 - A hypothetical protein in mmsB 3'region in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydiD.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR041w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR222c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YER147c.

All these proteins contains a highly  conserved  region  very rich in glycine,
serine, and threonine  which is  followed  by a conserved lysine.   A parallel
can be drawn [9]  between  this type of  domain and  the G-x(4)-G-K-[ST] ATP-/
GTP-binding 'P-loop' domain or  the protein kinases G-x-G-x(2)-[SG]-x(10,20)-K

Eukaroytic and  prokaryotic  molybdoenzymes  require  a molybdopterin cofactor

complex multistep  enzymatic  pathway. One of the eukaryotic proteins involved
in this pathway is the Drosophila protein cinnamon [1] which is highly similar
to gephyrin, a rat microtubule-associated protein  which was thought to anchor
the glycine  receptor  to  subsynaptic microtubules. Cinnamon and gephyrin are
evolutionary related,  in their  N-terminal half, to the Escherichia coli MoCF
biosynthesis proteins  mog/chlG  and moaB/chlA2 and, in their C-terminal half,
to Escherichia coli moeA/chlE.

As signature  patterns,  we selected two conserved regions: one located in the

under anaerobic  conditions by generation of an organic free radical, using S-
adenosylmethionine and reduced flavodoxin as cosubstrates to produce 5'-deoxy-

 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0021.

All these  proteins  possess,  in their N-terminal section, a highly conserved

Cytochrome b5  is  a  membrane-bound  hemoprotein  which  acts as an  electron

forms of b5, one  found in microsomes and one  found in the outer  membrane of
mitochondria.  Two conserved histidine residues serve as axial ligands for the
heme group.    The  structure of  a number  of oxidoreductases consists of the
juxtaposition of  a  heme-binding domain homologous to that of b5 and either a
flavodehydrogenase or a molybdopterin domain. These enzymes are:

 - Lactate dehydrogenase  (EC 1.1.2.3) [2], an   enzyme  that  consists  of  a
   flavodehydrogenase domain and a heme-binding domain called cytochrome b2.
 - Nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.1), a key enzyme involved in  the first step of
   nitrate  assimilation in  plants, fungi  and  bacteria [3,4]. Consists of a
   molybdopterin domain   (see  <PDOC00484>),  a  heme-binding  domain  called
   cytochrome b557, as well as a cytochrome reductase domain.
 - Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1) [5],  which catalyzes the terminal reaction in
   the oxidative degradation  of sulfur-containing  amino acids. Also consists
   of a molybdopterin domain and a heme-binding domain.
 - Yeast  acyl-CoA  desaturase  1  (EC  1.14.99.5)  (gene  OLE1).  This enzyme

* Cytochrome b/b6 signatures *
******************************

In the mitochondrion of eukaryotes and in aerobic prokaryotes, cytochrome b is
a component of respiratory chain complex III (EC 1.10.2.2) - also known as the
bc1 complex or  ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase.  In plant  chloroplasts  and
cyanobacteria, there is a analogous protein, cytochrome b6, a component of the
plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase  (EC  1.10.99.1),  also  known as the b6f
complex.

Cytochrome b/b6  [1,2]  is  an  integral membrane protein of approximately 400
amino acid residues that probably has 8 transmembrane segments.  In plants and
cyanobacteria, cytochrome  b6    consists  of two subunits encoded by the petB
and petD  genes. The sequence of petB is colinear with the  N-terminal part of
mitochondrial  cytochrome b,  while  petD  corresponds to the C-terminal part.
Cytochrome b/b6  non-covalently binds two heme groups, known as b562 and b566.
Four conserved  histidine  residues  are  postulated  to be the ligands of the
iron atoms of these two heme groups.

Apart from regions around some of the histidine heme  ligands, there are a few
conserved regions in the sequence of b/b6. The best conserved of these regions
includes an  invariant P-E-W triplet which lies in the loop that separates the
fifth and sixth transmembrane segments.  It seems to be important for electron
transfer  at the   ubiquinone redox site - called Qz or Qo (where o stands for
outside) - located on the outer side of the membrane.

A schematic representation of the structure of cytochrome b/b6 is shown below.

                   +---Fe-b562----+
                   | +---Fe-b566--|-+

        <----Cytochrome-b6-petB---------><--Cytochrome-b6-petD----->

We developed  two  signature  patterns for cytochrome b/b6. The first includes
the first conserved histidine of b/b6, which is a heme b562 ligand; the second
includes the conserved PEW triplet.

* Nickel-dependent hydrogenases b-type cytochrome subunit signatures *
**********************************************************************

Bacterial membrane-bound  nickel-dependent hydrogenases  [1,2,3]  seem  to  be
associated with  a  b-type  cytochrome  involved  in  electron  transfer  from
hydrogen to  oxygen. This cytochrome is a protein of about 28 Kd that seems to
have four  transmembrane  regions.  The  gene  coding  for  this cytochrome is
adjacent to that coding for the large subunit of the hydrogenase.  It has been
assigned a variety of names in different species: hupC, hyaC, hydC or hoxZ.

We developed two signature patterns for this protein. The first corresponds to
the first potential transmembrane region. The second signature includes the C-
terminal part  of  a  hydrophilic  loop  between  the  third  and  the  fourth
transmembrane region  as  well  as  the first half of the fourth transmembrane
region. Both signatures contain conserved histidines that could be involved in
binding the heme iron group.

* Succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b subunit signatures *
***********************************************************

Succinate dehydrogenase   (SDH)  is  a  membrane-bound  complex  of  two  main
components: a   membrane-extrinsic   component   composed   of  an FAD-binding
flavoprotein and an iron-sulfur protein, and a hydrophobic  component composed
of a cytochrome B and a membrane anchor protein. The cytochrome b component is
a mono heme transmembrane protein [1,2,3] belonging to a family that groups:

 - Cytochrome b-556 from bacterial SDH (gene sdhC).
 - Cytochrome b560 from the mammalian mitochondrial SDH complex.
 - Cytochrome b560 subunit encoded in the mitochondrial genome of some algae
   and in the plant Marchantia polymorpha.
 - Cytochrome b from yeast mitochondrial SDH complex (gene SDH3 or CYB3).
 - Protein cyt-1 from Caenorhabditis.

These cytochromes  are  proteins  of  about  130  residues that comprise three
transmembrane regions.  There  are  two  conserved  histidines  which  may  be
involved in  binding  the heme group. We developed two signature patterns that
include these histidine residues.

**********************************
* Thioredoxin family active site *
**********************************

Thioredoxins [1 to 4] are small proteins  of  approximately one hundred amino-
acid residues  which participate in various redox reactions via the reversible
oxidation of  an active center disulfide bond. They exist in either a  reduced
form or  an  oxidized  form  where  the two cysteine residues are linked in an
intramolecular disulfide  bond.  Thioredoxin  is  present  in  prokaryotes and
eukaryotes and   the  sequence  around the redox-active disulfide bond is well
conserved.  Bacteriophage T4    also encodes for a thioredoxin but its primary
structure is not homologous to bacterial, plant and vertebrate thioredoxins.

A number of  eukaryotic  proteins  contain  domains  evolutionary  related  to
thioredoxin, all of them  seem to be protein  disulphide isomerases (PDI). PDI
(EC 5.3.4.1)  [5,6,7]  is  an  endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that catalyzes the
rearrangement of disulfide bonds in various proteins. The various forms of PDI
which are currently known are:

 - PDI major isozyme; a multifunctional protein that also function as the beta
   subunit of   prolyl   4-hydroxylase  (EC  1.14.11.2),  as  a  component  of
   oligosaccharyl transferase (EC 2.4.1.119), as thyroxine deiodinase (EC 3.8.
   1.4), as glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase (EC 1.8.4.2) and as a thyroid
   hormone-binding protein !
 - ERp60 (ER-60; 58 Kd microsomal protein). ERp60 was originally thought to be
   a phosphoinositide-specific  phospholipase  C  isozyme  and  later  to be a
   protease.
 - ERp72.
 - P5.

All PDI contains two or three (ERp72) copies of the thioredoxin domain.

Bacterial proteins  that  act  as  thiol:disulfide  interchange  proteins that
allows disulfide  bond  formation  in some periplasmic proteins also contain a
thioredoxin domain. These proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli dsbA (or prfA) and its orthologs in Vibrio cholerae (tcpG)
   and Haemophilus influenzae (por).
 - Escherichia  coli  dsbC (or xpRA) and its orthologs in Erwinia chrysanthemi
   and Haemophilus influenzae.
 - Escherichia coli dsbD (or dipZ) and its Haemophilus influenzae ortholog.
 - Escherichia  coli  dsbE  (or ccmG) and orthologs in Haemophilus influenzae,
   Rhodobacter capsulatus (helX), Rhiziobiacae (cycY and tlpA).

* Glutaredoxin active site *
****************************

Glutaredoxin [1,2,3],  also known as thioltransferase,  is  a small protein of
approximately one  hundred  amino-acid  residues.  It functions as an electron
carrier in  the glutathione-dependent synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides by the
enzyme  ribonucleotide  reductase.  Like  thioredoxin,  which  functions  in a
similar way, glutaredoxin possesses an active center disulfide bond. It exists
in either  a  reduced  or an oxidized form where the two cysteine residues are
linked in an intramolecular disulfide bond.

Glutaredoxin has  been  sequenced  in  a  variety  of species. On the basis of
extensive sequence similarity, it has  been proposed [4] that vaccinia protein
O2L is  most  probably a glutaredoxin. Finally, it must be noted that phage T4
thioredoxin seems also to be evolutionary related.

*******************************************

Blue or 'type-1'  copper  proteins  are   small proteins which  bind  a single
copper atom and which are characterized  by  an intense  electronic absorption
band near 600 nm [1,2]. The most well known members of  this class of proteins
are the  plant   chloroplastic   plastocyanins, which exchange  electrons with
cytochrome  c6, and the  distantly  related bacterial  azurins, which exchange
electrons with cytochrome  c551. This family of proteins also includes all the
proteins listed below  (references  are  only provided for recently determined
sequences).

 - Amicyanin from bacteria such as Methylobacterium extorquens or Thiobacillus
   versutus that can grow on methylamine.  Amicyanin appears to be an electron
   receptor for methylamine dehydrogenase.
 - Auracyanins A and B  from Chloroflexus aurantiacus [3].  These proteins can
   donate electrons to cytochrome c-554.
 - Blue copper protein from Alcaligenes faecalis.
 - Cupredoxin (CPC) from cucumber peelings [4].
 - Cusacyanin (basic blue protein; plantacyanin, CBP) from cucumber.
 - Halocyanin from Natrobacterium pharaonis [5], a membrane associated copper-
   binding protein.
 - Pseudoazurin from Pseudomonas.
 - Rusticyanin  from  Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.  Rusticyanin is  an  electron
   carrier from cytochrome c-552 to the a-type oxidase [6].
 - Stellacyanin from the Japanese lacquer tree.
 - Umecyanin from horseradish roots.

 - Allergen Ra3 from ragweed.  This pollen protein  is evolutionary related to
   the above proteins, but seems to have lost the ability to bind copper.

Although there is an appreciable amount of divergence  in the  sequence of all
these proteins, the copper ligand sites are  conserved and we have developed a
pattern which includes two of the ligands: a cysteine and a histidine.

************************************************************

Ferredoxins [1] are a group of iron-sulfur  proteins  which  mediate  electron
transfer in a wide variety of metabolic reactions.  Ferredoxins can be divided
into several subgroups depending upon  the  physiological  nature  of the iron
sulfur  cluster(s)  and  according to  sequence  similarities.  One  of  these
subgroups are the 2Fe-2S ferredoxins, which are proteins or  domains of around
one hundred amino acid residues that bind a single 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster.
The proteins that are known [2] to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Ferredoxin from photosynthetic organisms;  namely plants and algae where it
   is located in the chloroplast or cyanelle; and cyanobacteria.
 - Ferredoxin from archaebacteria of the Halobacterium genus.
 - Ferredoxin IV (gene pftA) and V (gene fdxD) from Rhodobacter capsulatus.
 - Ferredoxin in the  toluene  degradation  operon (gene xylT) and naphthalene
   degradation operon (gene nahT) of Pseudomonas putida.
 - Hypothetical Escherichia coli protein yfaE.

 - The N-terminal domain  of the  bifunctional ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase
   electron  transfer  component of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase complex (gene
   benC) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the toluene 4-monooxygenase complex
   (gene tmoF), the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system (gene xylZ), and the xylene

 - The N-terminal domain of  phenol  hydroxylase  protein  p5 (gene dmpP) from
   Pseudomonas Putida.
 - The N-terminal domain of  methane  monooxygenase   component C  (gene mmoC)

   from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
 - The central domain of eukaryotic succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) iron-

 - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic xanthine dehydrogenase.
 - The N-terminal domain of eukaryotic aldehyde oxidase.

In the 2Fe-2S  ferredoxins,  four   cysteine  residues bind  the   iron-sulfur
cluster. Three of these cysteines are clustered together in the same region of
the protein. Our signature pattern spans that iron-sulfur binding region.

* 4Fe-4S ferredoxins, iron-sulfur binding region signature *
************************************************************

Ferredoxins  [1]  are a group  of  iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron
transfer in  a  wide variety  of   metabolic  reactions.   Ferredoxins  can be
divided into several subgroups  depending upon the physiological nature of the
iron-sulfur  cluster(s).   One of these  subgroups are the 4Fe-4S ferredoxins,
which  are  found  in   bacteria  and  which   are thus  often    referred  as
'bacterial-type' ferredoxins.  The structure of these proteins [2] consists of
the duplication of a  domain of twenty six amino  acid residues; each of these
domains contains four cysteine residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center.

A number  of  proteins  have  been found [3]  that  include one or more 4Fe-4S
binding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins
are  listed  below  (references  are  only  provided  for  recently determined
sequences).

 - The iron-sulfur proteins  of  the succinate  dehydrogenase and the fumarate
   reductase  complexes (EC 1.3.99.1).  These  enzyme   complexes,  which  are
   components of the tricarboxylic  acid cycle, each contain three subunits: a
   flavoprotein,  an iron-sulfur protein,  and a b-type cytochrome.  The iron-
   sulfur proteins contain three  different  iron-sulfur  centers: a 2Fe-2S, a
   3Fe-3S  and a 4Fe-4S.
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5)
   This enzyme is composed of three subunits: A, B, and C. The C subunit seems
   to be an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-
   terminal part of the  protein.
 - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.  The  B subunit of
   this  enzyme  (gene dmsB)  is  an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  four  4Fe-4S
   ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Escherichia coli  formate  hydrogenlyase.  Two   of  the  subunits  of this
   oligomeric complex (genes hycB and hycF) seem  to  be  iron-sulfur proteins
   that each contain two 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Methanobacterium formicicum formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). This enzyme
   is used by the archaebacteria  to grow on formate.  The  beta chain of this
   dimeric enzyme probably binds two 4Fe-4S centers.
 - Escherichia  coli  formate  dehydrogenases  N  and O (EC 1.2.1.2). The beta
   chain  of these two enzymes (genes fdnH and fdoH) are  iron-sulfur proteins
   with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
 - Desulfovibrio periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase (EC 1.18.99.1).  The large chain
   of this dimeric enzyme binds three 4Fe-4S centers, two of which are located
   in the ferredoxin-like N-terminal region of the protein.
 - Methanobacterium  thermoautrophicum  methyl  viologen-reducing  hydrogenase
   subunit mvhB, which contains six  tandemly repeated ferredoxin-like domains
   and which probably binds twelve 4Fe-4S centers.
 - Salmonella typhimurium anaerobic sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) [4]. Two of
   the subunits of  this enzyme (genes asrA and asrC) seem  to  both  bind two
   4Fe-4S centers.
 - A Ferredoxin-like protein  (gene fixX)  from  the  nitrogen-fixation  genes
   locus of various  Rhizobium  species,  and   one  from  the  Nif-region  of
   Azotobacter species.
 - The 9 Kd  polypeptide  of chloroplast photosystem I [5]  (gene psaC).  This
   protein contains two low potential 4Fe-4S centers, referred as  the A and B
   centers.
 - The chloroplast frxB protein which is predicted to carry two 4Fe-4S centers.
 - An ferredoxin  from a  primitive  eukaryote,  the enteric amoeba  Entamobea
   histolytica.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  yjjW, a protein with a N-terminal
   region belonging to the radical activating enzymes family (see <PDOC00834>)
   and two potential 4Fe-4S centers.

The pattern of cysteine  residues in the  iron-sulfur region  is sufficient to
detect this class of 4Fe-4S binding proteins.

-Consensus pattern: C-x(2)-C-x(2)-C-x(3)-C-[PEG]
                    [The four C's are 4Fe-4S ligands]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: the majority
 of known 4Fe-4S sequences, with very few exceptions.

-Note: in some  bacterial  ferredoxins,  one of the two duplicated domains has
 lost one or  more of  the four conserved  cysteines.  The consequence of such
 variations is that these domains  have  either lost their iron-sulfur binding
 property or bind to a 3Fe-3S center instead of a 4Fe-4S center.
-Note: the last residue of this  pattern in most  proteins  belonging  to this
 group,  is a Pro; the  only  exceptions  are  the  Rhizobium  ferredoxin-like
 proteins which have Gly, and two Desulfovibrio ferredoxins which have Glu. It
 must also be noted that  the  three  non  4Fe-4S-binding  proteins  which are
 picked-up by the pattern have Gly in this position of the pattern.

High potential  iron-sulfur  proteins  (HiPIP)  [1,E1] are a specific class of
high-redox potential  4Fe-4S  ferredoxins that functions in anaerobic electron
transport and  which  occurs  in  photosynthetic  bacteria  and  in Paracoccus
denitrificans.

The HiPIPs are  small  proteins  which show  significant  variation  in  their
sequences, their sizes  (from 63 to 85 amino acids),  and  in their oxidation-
reduction potentials.  As  shown in the following schematic representation the
iron-sulfur cluster is bound by four conserved cysteine residues.

* Rieske iron-sulfur protein signatures *
*****************************************

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.10.2.2)  (also known as the bc1 complex
or complex III) is  one of the  electron transport  chains of mitochondria and
of some aerobic prokaryotes; it catalyzes the  oxidoreduction of ubiquinol and
cytochrome c. In the chloroplast of plants and in cyanobacteria plastoquinone-
plastocyanin  reductase (EC 1.10.99.1)  (also  known as  the b6f  complex)  is
functionally  similar  and catalyzes  the  oxidoreduction of plastoquinol  and
cytochrome f.

One of the components  of  these  electron  transfer systems is an iron-sulfur
protein with a 2Fe-2S cluster,  which is  called the Rieske protein [1,2]. The
Rieske protein contains approximately 190 amino acid residues. The iron-sulfur
cluster is complexed to the protein through cysteine and histidine residues.

Two perfectly  conserved  regions in Rieske proteins contains all the residues
that bind  the  iron-sulfur cluster. Both regions contain two cysteines and an
histidine. The  first  cysteine and the histidine are 2Fe-2S ligands while the
remaining cysteines  form  a  disulfide  bond  [3].  We  have selected the two
conserved regions as signature patterns.

MT's occur  throughout the animal kingdom and are also found in higher plants,
fungi and some prokaryotes. On the basis of structural relationships MT's have
been subdivided into three classes. Class I includes mammalian MT's as well as
MT's from crustacean and molluscs, but with clearly related primary structure.
Class II groups together MT's from various species such as sea urchins, fungi,

Ferritin [1,2] is one of the major non-heme iron storage proteins. It consists
of a mineral core of hydrated ferric  oxide, and a multi-subunit protein shell
which  englobes   the  former  and   assures   its   solubility in  an aqueous
environment.

In animals the protein is mainly cytoplasmic  and  there  are generally two or
more genes that encodes for closely related subunits (in mammals there are two
subunits which are known as H(eavy) and L(ight)).  In plants ferritin is found
in the chloroplast [3].

There are a number  of well conserved  region in the sequence of ferritins. We
have selected two  of  these regions to  develop signature patterns. The first
pattern is located in the  central  part  of  the  sequence of ferritin and it
contains  three  conserved  glutamate  which are thought to be involved in the
binding of iron.  The second pattern  is located in the C-terminal section, it
corresponds to a region  which forms a hydrophilic channel through which small
molecules and ions can gain access to the central cavity of the molecule; this
pattern also  includes  conserved  acidic  residues  which are potential metal

* Transferrins signatures *
***************************

Transferrins are a family of eukaryotic iron-binding  glycoproteins that share
the common function of controlling the level of free iron in biological fluids
[1]. The transferrin family currently includes:

 - Blood serotransferrin (siderophilin).
 - Milk lactotransferrin (lactoferrin).
 - Egg white ovotransferrin (conalbumin).
 - Membrane-associated melanotransferrin.

Transferrins are  proteins of 650 to 700  residues which have evolved from the
duplication of a domain of around 340 residues. Each of the duplicated domains
binds one atom of iron. Each iron atom is bound by four conserved residues: an
aspartic acid,  two tyrosines, and a histidine [2].    All of the cysteines in
both domains are involved in intradomain disulfide bonds.

We have developed three different signature patterns for transferrins. Each of
them is centered  on one of  the  iron-binding residue,  respectively  the two
tyrosines and the histidine.   Each of the signatures is present twice in each
type of transferrins.

*******************
* Globins profile *
*******************

Globins are heme-containing  proteins involved in  binding and/or transporting
oxygen [1].  They  belong  to  a  very  large and well studied family which is
widely distributed in many organisms. The major groups of globins are:

 - Hemoglobins  (Hb)    from  vertebrates. Hb is the protein  responsible  for
   transporting oxygen  from  the  lungs to other tissues. It is a tetramer of
   two alpha  and  two  beta  chains.  Most  vertebrate  species  also express
   specific embryonic or fetal forms of hemoglobin where the alpha or the beta
   chains are  replaced  by  a  chain  with higher oxygen affinity, as for the
   gamma, delta, epsilon and zeta chains in mammals, for example.
 - Myoglobins (Mg) from vertebrates. Mg is a monomeric protein responsible for
   oxygen storage in muscles.
 - Invertebrate   globins  [2].  A  wide  variety  of  globins  are  found  in
   invertebrates. Molluscs generally have one or two muscle globins which  are
   either monomeric or dimeric.  Insects, such as the midge Chironomus thummi,
   have a large set of extracellular globins.  Nematodes  and  annelids have a
   variety of intracellular and extracellular globins; some of them are multi-
   domain  polypeptides (from two up to nine-domain  globins) and some produce
   large, disulfide-bonded aggregates.
 - Leghemoglobins (Lg) from the root nodules of leguminous plants. Lg provides
   oxygen for bacteroids.
 - Flavohemoproteins  from  bacteria  (Escherichia coli hmpA)  and  fungi [3].
   These proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal globin domain
   and a C-terminal  FAD-containing  reductase  domain.  In  bacteria  such as
   Vitreoscilla, the enzyme-associated globin is a single domain protein.

All these    globins  seem to have evolved from a common ancestor. The profile
developed to detect members  of the globin family  is  based  on a  structural
alignment of selected globin sequences.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 1.

-Note: protozoan/cyanobacterial  globins  belong  to  another  family which is
 described in <PDOC00933>.

* Protozoan/cyanobacterial globins signature *
**********************************************

Globins are heme-containing  proteins involved in  binding and/or transporting
oxygen [1]. Almost all globins belong to a large family (see <PDOC00793>), the
only exceptions  are  the  following proteins which form a family of their own
[2,3]:

 - Monomeric  hemoglobins  from the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, Tetrahymena
   pyriformis and Tetrahymena thermophila.
 - Cyanoglobin from the cyanobacteria Nostoc commune.
 - Globins  LI637  and  LI410  from  the chloroplast of the alga Chlamydomonas
   eugametos.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY48.23.

These proteins  contain a conserved histidine which could be involved in heme-
binding. As a signature pattern, we use a conserved region that ends with this
residue.

Leghemoglobins [1] are hemoproteins  present in the root nodules of leguminous
plants. Leghemoglobins are structurally and functionally related to hemoglobin
and myoglobin.  By providing  oxygen to the bacteroids, they are essential for
symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Structurally related hemoglobins from the nodules
of non-leguminous  plants [2,3], and from  the roots of  non-nodulating plants
[4] have been recently sequenced.   We have developed a signature pattern that
picks up the sequence of plants hemoglobins, exclusively.

* Hemerythrins signature *
**************************

Marine invertebrates such  as annelids or sipunculans  possess  two completely
different types of oxygen binding  proteins: globins  which  are  found in the
blood and hemerythrins which are found in the vascular system and the coelemic
fluid or in muscles (myohemerythrins).  Hemerythrins and myohemerythrins [1,2]
are small proteins of about 110 to 129 amino acid residues that bind two  iron
atoms. Five  histidines, one glutamic acid  and one aspartic acid are involved
in the binding of the iron atoms.

Ovohemerythrin [3], a yolk protein  from the leech Theromyzon tessulatum seems
to belong to this family of proteins, it may play a role in the detoxification
of free iron after a blood meal.

As a signature pattern we selected a region, located in the C-terminal section
of these proteins and that  contains two of the iron-ligands: a histidine  and
an aspartic acid.

* Arthropod hemocyanins / insect LSPs signatures *
**************************************************

Hemocyanins are copper-containing  oxygen  carriers occurring freely dissolved
in the hemolymph of many molluscs  and  arthropods [1].  Arthropod hemocyanins
consist  of  hexamer or  multi-hexamers with  subunits of about 75 Kd. Each of
these subunits binds two copper ions.

Larval storage proteins (LSP) [2] are proteins  from the hemolymph of insects,
which may serve as  a  store of  amino acids  for synthesis of adult proteins.
There are two classes of LSP's: arylphorins,  which are rich in aromatic amino
acids, and methionine-rich LSP's.  LSP's forms hexameric complexes.  LSP's are
structurally related to arthropod hemocyanins.

In the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni  a  protein  has  been  found [3] which is
associated with larval metamorphosis.  This  protein,  which  is called acidic
juvenile hormone-suppressible protein 1 (AJSP-1) is  also structurally related
to arthropod hemocyanins.

As signature patterns for these  proteins  we selected  two conserved regions,
the first  of  these  regions is located  in the  N-terminal  section of these
proteins  and  include a conserved  histidine  residue  which, in hemocyanins,
binds a copper atom.  The second pattern is located in the central part of the
protein.

*********************************
* Heavy-metal-associated domain *
*********************************

A conserved  domain  of  about  30 amino acid residues has been found [1] in a
number of    proteins  that  transport  or  detoxify heavy metals. This domain
contains two  conserved  cysteines  that  could  be involved in the binding of
these metals.  The domain has been termed Heavy-Metal-Associated (HMA). It has
been found in:

 - A  variety  of  cation transport ATPases (E1-E2 ATPases) (see <PDOC00139>).
   The human copper ATPAses ATP7A and ATP7B which are respectively involved in
   Menke's and Wilson's diseases. ATP7A and ATP7B both contain 6 tandem copies
   of the  HMA  domain.  The copper ATPases CCC2 from budding yeast, copA from
   Enterococcus faecalis  and  synA from Synechococcus contain one copy of the
   HMA domain.  The cadmium ATPases cadA from Bacillus firmus and from plasmid
   pI258 from  Staphylococcus  aureus  also contain a single HMA domain, while
   a chromosomal  Staphylococcus  aureus cadA contains two copies. Other, less
   characterized ATPases  that contain the HMA domain are: fixI from Rhizobium
   meliloti, pacS  from  Synechococcus strain  PCC 7942), Mycobacterium leprae
   ctpA and  ctpB and Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhhO. In all these
   ATPases the HMA domain(s) are located in the N-terminal section.
 - Mercuric reductase (EC 1.16.1.1) (gene merA)  which is generally encoded by
   plasmids carried  by  mercury-resistant  Gram-negative  bacteria.  Mercuric
   reductase is a class-1 pyridine  nucleotide-disulphide  oxidoreductase (see
   <PDOC00073>). There  is  generally  one HMA domain (with the exception of a
   chromosomal merA  from  Bacillus  strain  RC607  which  has  two) in the N-
   terminal part of merA.
 - Mercuric  transport protein periplasmic component (gene merP), also encoded
   by plasmids  carried  by mercury-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. It seems
   to be  a  mercury  scavenger  that specifically binds to one Hg(2+) ion and
   which passes  it  to  the  mercuric  reductase via the merT protein. The N-
   terminal half of merP is a HMA domain.
 - Helicobacter pylori copper-binding protein copP.
 - Yeast   protein   ATX1  [2],  which  could  act  in  the  transport  and/or
   partitioning of copper.

The consensus pattern for HMA spans the complete domain.

* ABC transporters family signature *
*************************************

On the  basis  of   sequence  similarities a    family of related  ATP-binding
proteins has been characterized [1 to 5]. These proteins are associated with a
variety of  distinct  biological processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
but  a majority of them are involved in active  transport of small hydrophilic
molecules  across  the  cytoplasmic  membrane.   All  these  proteins  share a

   a C-terminal ABC transporter domain.

As a signature pattern for this class of proteins, we use a  conserved  region
which is located between the 'A' and the 'B' motifs of the ATP-binding site.

It has been shown [3,4] that most of these proteins contain a conserved region
located about 80 to 100 residues from their C-terminal extremity. This  region
seems [5]  to  be  located  in  a  cytoplasmic  loop between two transmembrane
domains. Apart  from  the  conserved region, the sequence of these proteins is
quite divergent, however they can be classified into seven families which have
been respectively termed: araH, cysTW, fecCD, hisMQ, livHM, malFG and oppBC.

We built  a  signature  pattern  from  the best conserved positions within the
conserved region.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: a   majority

 families. It  also  fails  to  detect  amiCD,  artM, dppC, gltJK, lacG, msmG,
 nikBC, phnM, sapBC and sfuB.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 68.

-Note: as it can be seen above, this pattern is far from optimal. We therefore
 plan to replace it by profiles specific to each family.

* ABC-2 type transport system integral membrane proteins signature *
********************************************************************

Integral membrane components of a number of bacterial active transport systems
have been  shown  to  be  evolutionary  related  and to form a distinct family
[1,2]. These proteins are:

 - Escherichia coli kpsM, involved in polysialic acid export.
 - Haemophilus  influenzae  bexB,  involved  in  polyribosylribitol  phosphate
   capsule polysaccharide export.
 - Salmonella typhi vexB, involved in translocation of the Vi polysaccharide.
 - Neisseria  meningitidis  ctrC,  involved  in  polyneuraminic  acid  capsule
   polysaccharide export.
 - Rhizobiacae   nodulation  protein  J  (gene  nodJ),  probably  involved  in
   exporting a modified beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine oligosaccharide.
 - Streptomyces   peucetius   drrB,  involved  in  exporting  the  antibiotics
   daunorubicin and doxorubicin.
 - Klebsiella pneumoniae O-antigen exprt system protein rfbA.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica O-antigen exprt system protein rfbD.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yadH.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhhJ.

The molecular  size  of  these  proteins  is around 30 Kd. They are thought to
contain six transmembrane regions. They either form homooligomeric channels or
associate with  another  type of transmembrane protein to form heteroligomers.
Transport systems  in  which  they participate are energized by an ATP-binding
protein that  belongs  to  the ABC transporter family. The designation 'ABC-2'
has been proposed [1] for these transport systems.

As a  signature  pattern, we  selected  a  conserved  region  located  in  the
C-terminal section of these proteins.

* Bacterial extracellular solute-binding proteins, family 1 signature *
***********************************************************************

Bacterial high affinity transport systems are involved in active  transport of
solutes across  the  cytoplasmic  membrane.  The  protein  components of these
traffic systems  include  one  or two transmembrane protein components, one or
two membrane-associated    ATP-binding   proteins   (ABC   transporters;   see
<PDOC00185>) and a high affinity periplasmic solute-binding protein. The later
are thought  to  bind the substrate in the vicinity of the inner membrane, and
to transfer  it to a complex of inner membrane proteins for concentration into
the cytoplasm.

In gram-positive  bacteria  which are surrounded by a single membrane and have
therefore no  periplasmic  region  the  equivalent  proteins  are bound to the
membrane via an N-terminal lipid anchor. These homolog proteins do not play an
integral role in the transport process per se, but probably serve as receptors
to trigger  or  initiate  translocation of the solute  through the membrane by
binding to  external  sites  of  the  integral membrane proteins of the efflux
system.

In addition  at  least some solute-binding proteins function in the initiation
of sensory transduction pathways.

On the  basis  of  sequence  similarities,  the vast majority of these solute-
binding proteins  can  be  grouped  [1] into eight families of clusters, which
generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound.

Family 1 currently includes the following proteins:

 - Periplasmic  maltose/maltodextrin-binding  proteins  of  Enterobacteriaceae
   (gene malE)  and  homologous  lipoprotein in Streptococcus pneumoniae (gene
   malX).
 - Periplasmic  multiple  oligo-saccharide  binding  protein  of Streptococcus
   mutans (gene msmE), which is involved in the uptake of melibiose, raffinose
   and isomaltotriose.
 - Periplasmic  glycerol-3-phosphate-binding  protein  of  Escherichia coli, a
   component of   the   phosphate-limitation   inducible   uptake  system  for
   sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and glycerophosphoryl diesters.
 - Periplasmic  iron-binding  protein from Serratia marcescens (gene sfuA) and
   the homologous   proteins   (gene  fbp)  from  Haemophilus  influenzae  and
   Neisseria, which are part of the iron-acquisition system.
 - Periplasmic thiamine-binding  protein (gene tbpA) from Escherichia coli and
   Haemophilus influenzae.

The signature  pattern  for  this  family is located in the central section of
the mature proteins.

**********************************
* Serum albumin family signature *
**********************************

The following  serum  transport  proteins are known to be evolutionary related
[1,2,3]:

 - Albumin  (ALB), the main protein of plasma. It binds water, cations such as
   Ca++, Na+,  K+,  fatty  acids,  hormones,  bilirubin  and  drugs.  Its main
   function is the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.
 - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (alpha-fetoglobulin). AFP is a fetal plasma protein
   which also binds various cations, fatty acids and bilirubin.
 - Vitamin D-binding protein (VDB), also known  as group-specific component or
   Gc-globulin. VDB binds to  vitamin D and  its metabolites as  well as fatty
   acids.
 - Afamin (or alpha-albumin),  a  protein  whose  biochemical  role is not yet
   characterized.

Structurally, these proteins consist of three homologous domains  of about 190
amino acids.  Each  domain  contains  five  or six internal disulfide bonds as
shown in the following schematic representation.

                    +---+          +----+                        +-----+

Transthyretin (prealbumin) [1] is a thyroid hormone-binding protein that seems
to transport thyroxine (T4) from the bloodstream to the brain. It is a protein
of about  130  amino  acids that  assembles as a homotetramer and  forms    an
internal channel that binds thyroxine. Transthyretin is mainly synthesized  in
the brain  choroid  plexus.  In humans, variants of the protein are associated
with distinct forms of amyloidosis.

The sequence  of transthyretin is highly conserved in vertebrates. A number of
uncharacterized proteins also belong to this family:

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yedX.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yunM.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein R09H10.3.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK697.8.

We selected  two  regions  as  signature patterns. The first located in the N-

* Avidin / Streptavidin family signature *
******************************************

Avidin [1]  is a minor constituent of egg white in several groups of oviparous
vertebrates.  Avidin,  which was discovered in the 1920's, takes its name from
the  avidity  with which it binds biotin. These two molecules bind so strongly
that is highly difficult to separate them. Streptavidin is  a protein produced
by Streptomyces  avidinii    which    also  binds biotin and whose sequence is
evolutionary related to that of avidin.

Avidin and streptavidin both  form  homotetrameric  complexes of noncovalently
associated chains.  Each  chain  forms a very strong and specific non-covalent
complex with one molecule of biotin.

Fibropellins I and III [2] are proteins that form the apical lamina of the sea
urchin embryo,  a  component  of  the extracellular matrix. These two proteins
have a  modular structure composed of a CUB domain (see <PDOC00908>), followed
by a variable number of EGF repeats and a C-terminal avidin-like domain.

The three-dimensional  structures  of  both  streptavidin [3,4] and avidin [5]
have been  determined  and  revealed  them  to  share  a common fold: an eight
stranded anti-parallel  beta-barrel  with  a repeated +1 topology enclosing an
internal ligand binding site.

As a signature sequence  for  this  family of proteins we selected a conserved
domain located  in  the  C-terminal  section  of  avidin/streptavidin  and the
avidin-like domain.

 proteins <PDOC00188> families [6,7].

* Eukaryotic cobalamin-binding proteins signature *
***************************************************

In eukaryotes, a number of proteins  are involved in the binding and transport
of cobalamin (vitamin B12) [1]. Some of them have been sequenced and have been
shown [2,3] to  be evolutionary related and are listed below:

 - Intrinsic factor (IF).  The function of IF  is to promote the absorption of
   cobalamin in the ileum by specific receptor-mediated endocytosis.
 - Transcobalamin I (TC1)   (also called  R-binder  protein).  TC1  transports
   cobalamin from blood to cells.
 - Transcobalamin II (TC2). TC2 transports cobalamin from blood to cells.
 - Haptocorrin (cobalophilin). Haptocorrin binds to cobalamin and to cobalamin
   derivatives such as cobinamide.  It  may  play  a  role  in  preventing the
   absorption of cobalamin analogues produced by bacteria.

These glycoproteins are polypeptides of about 400  amino acids that share many
regions of  similarity. As a signature pattern, we selected a highly conserved
region in their central part.

* Lipocalin signature *
***********************

Proteins which transport small hydrophobic molecules such as steroids, bilins,
retinoids, and  lipids share limited regions of sequence homology and a common
tertiary structure   architecture   [1  to  5].  This  is  an  eight  stranded
antiparallel beta-barrel  with  a  repeated  + 1 topology enclosing a internal
ligand binding  site  [1,3].  The name 'lipocalin' has  been  proposed [5] for
this protein  family. Proteins known to belong to this family are listed below
(references are only provided for recently determined sequences).

 - Alpha-1-microglobulin (protein HC), which seems to bind porphyrin.
 - Alpha-1-acid  glycoprotein (orosomucoid), which can bind a remarkable array
   of natural and synthetic compounds [6].
 - Aphrodisin which, in hamsters, functions as an aphrodisiac pheromone.
 - Apolipoprotein D, which probably binds heme-related compounds.
 - Beta-lactoglobulin, a milk protein whose  physiological function appears to
   bind retinol.
 - Complement component C8 gamma chain, which seems to bind retinol [7].
 - Crustacyanin [8], a protein from lobster carapace, which binds astaxanthin,
   a carotenoid.
 - Epididymal-retinoic  acid  binding  protein (E-RABP) [9] involved  in sperm
   maturation.
 - Insectacyanin, a moth bilin-binding protein, and a related butterfly bilin-
   binding protein (BBP).
 - Late Lactation protein (LALP), a milk protein from tammar wallaby [10].
 - Neutrophil  gelatinase-associated  lipocalin (NGAL)  (p25)  (SV-40  induced
   24p3 protein) [11].
 - Odorant-binding protein (OBP), which binds odorants.
 - Plasma retinol-binding proteins (PRBP).
 - Human pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2 globulin.
 - Probasin (PB), a rat prostatic protein.
 - Prostaglandin D synthase (EC 5.3.99.2) (GSH-independent PGD synthetase),  a
   lipocalin with enzymatic activity [12].
 - Purpurin, a retinal protein which binds retinol and heparin.
 - Quiescence specific protein p20K from chicken (embryo CH21 protein).
 - Rodent urinary proteins (alpha-2-microglobulin), which may bind pheromones.
 - VNSP 1 and 2,  putative pheromone transport proteins from mouse vomeronasal
   organ [13].
 - Von  Ebner's  gland  protein  (VEGP)  [14]  (also called tear lipocalin), a
   mammalian protein  which may be involved in taste recognition.
 - A frog olfactory protein, which may transport odorants.
 - A  protein found in the cerebrospinal fluid of the toad Bufo Marinus with a
   supposed function  similar  to transthyretin in transport  across the blood
   brain barrier [15].
 - Lizard's  epididymal  secretory protein IV (LESP IV), which could transport
   small hydrophobic   molecules   into  the  epididymal  fluid  during  sperm
   maturation [16].
 - Prokaryotic outer-membrane protein blc [17].

The sequences  of  most  members of the family, the core or kernal lipocalins,
are characterized  by  three  short  conserved  stretches  of residues [3,18].
Others, the  outlier lipocalin group, share only one or two of these [3,18]. A
signature pattern was built around the first, common to all outlier and kernal
lipocalins, which occurs near the start of the first beta-strand.

* Cytosolic fatty-acid binding proteins signature *
***************************************************

A number of  low molecular  weight proteins which  bind fatty  acids and other
organic anions are present in the cytosol [1,2]. Most of them are structurally
related and have probably diverged from a common ancestor. This structure is a
ten stranded  antiparallel  beta-barrel,  albeit  with  a  wide  discontinuity
between the fourth and fifth strands, with a repeated + 1 topology enclosing a
internal ligand  binding  site  [2,7]. Proteins known to belong to this family
include:

 - Six,  tissue-specific,  types  of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) found
   in liver,  intestine, heart, epidermal, adipocyte, brain/retina. Heart FABP
   is also  known  as  mammary-derived growth inhibitor (MDGI), a protein that
   reversibly inhibits  proliferation  of  mammary  carcinoma cells. Epidermal
   FABP is also known as psoriasis-associated FABP [3].
 - Insect muscle fatty acid-binding proteins.
 - Testis lipid binding protein (TLBP).
 - Cellular retinol-binding proteins I and II (CRBP).
 - Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP).
 - Gastrotropin, an ileal protein which stimulates gastric acid and pepsinogen
   secretion. It seems that gastrotropin binds to bile salts and bilirubins.
 - Fatty  acid  binding  proteins  MFB1 and MFB2 from the midgut of the insect
   Manduca sexta [4].

In addition to the above cytosolic proteins, this family also includes:

 - Myelin P2 protein, which may be a lipid transport protein in Schwann cells.
   P2 is associated with the lipid bilayer of myelin.
 - Schistosoma mansoni protein Sm14 [5] which seems  to  be  involved  in  the
   transport of fatty acids.
 - Ascaris  suum  p18  a secreted protein that may play a role in sequestering
   potentially toxic  fatty  acids and their peroxidation products or that may
   be involved  in  the  maintenance  of  the  impermeable  lipid layer of the
   eggshell.
 - Hypothetical  fatty  acid-binding  proteins  F40F4.2,  F40F4.3, F40F4.4 and
   ZK742.5 from Caenorhabditis elegans.

We use as a signature pattern for these proteins a segment from the N-terminal
extremity.

**************************************
* Acyl-CoA-binding protein signature *
**************************************

Acyl-CoA-binding protein  (ACBP) is a small (10 Kd) protein that binds medium-
and long-chain  acyl-CoA esters with very high affinity and may function as an
intracellular carrier  of  acyl-CoA  esters  [1].    ACBP  is  also  known  as
diazepam  binding inhibitor (DBI) or endozepine (EP) because of its ability to
displace diazepam  from  the  benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site located on
the GABA type A receptor. It is therefore possible that this protein also acts
as a neuropeptide to modulate the action of the GABA receptor [2].

ACBP is a highly conserved  protein  of about 90 residues that has been so far
found in vertebrates, insects, plants and yeast.

ACBP belongs to a family that also includes:

 - Endozepine-like peptide (ELP) (gene DBIL5) from mouse [3]. ELP is a testis-
   specific  ACBP homolog that may be involved in the energy metabolism of the
   mature sperm.
 - MA-DBI, a transmembrane protein of unknown function which has been found in
   mammals. MA-DBI contains a N-terminal ACBP-like domain.
 - DRS-1  [4],  a human protein of unknown function that contains a N-terminal
   ACBP-like domain and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA isomerase/hydratase domain.

As a signature pattern we selected  the region  that corresponds to residue 19
to 37 in mammalian ACBP.

* LBP / BPI / CETP family signature *
*************************************

The following  mammalian  lipid-binding serum glycoproteins belong to the same
family [1,2,3]:

 - Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP).  LBP binds to the lipid A  moiety
   of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present  in  the outer
   membrane of  all  Gram-negative bacteria.  The  LBP/LPS  complex  seems  to
   interact with the CD14 receptor and may be responsible for the secretion of
   alpha-TNF.
 - Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI). Like LBP, BPI binds LPS
   and has a cytotoxic activity on Gram-negative bacteria.
 - Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP is involved in the transfer
   of insoluble cholesteryl esters in reverse cholesterol transport.
 - Phospholipid  transfer protein (PLTP). May play a key role in extracellular
   phospholipid transport and modulation of HDL particles.

These proteins are structurally related  and  share  many  regions of sequence
similarities.  As a signature pattern  we  have selected one of these regions,
which is located in  the N-terminal  section of these proteins; a region which
could be involved in the binding to the lipids [2].

Mammalian phosphatidylethanolamine-binding   protein  (also  knowns  as  basic

tissues [1].  It  binds hydrophobic ligands, such as phosphatidylethanolamine,
but also  seems  [2]  to bind nucleotides such as GTP and FMN, it is suggested
that it could act in membrane  remodeling  during growth and maturation.  This
protein belongs to a family that also includes:

 - Drosophila antennal protein A5, a putative odorant-binding protein.
 - Onchocerca volvulus antigen Ov-16 and the related proteins D1, D2 and D3.
 - Plasmodium falciparum putative phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein.
 - Toxocara  canis secreted antigen TES-26. This larval protein has been shown
   to bind phosphatidylethanolamine.
 - Yeast  protein  DKA1  (also  known  as  NSP1 or TFS1). The function of this
   protein is not very clear.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YLR179C.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F40A3.3.

Plant cells contain proteins,  called lipid transfer  proteins  (LTP) [1,2,3],

could play  a  major  role  in  membrane biogenesis by conveying phospholipids
such as  waxes or cutin from their site of biosynthesis to membranes unable to

Plant LTP's are  proteins  of  about 9 Kd (90 amino acids) which contain eight

* Uteroglobin family signatures *
*********************************

Uteroglobin [1] is a protein that seems specific to lagomorphes (rabbit, hare,
and pica) and which binds progesterone specifically and with high affinity. It
may regulate  progesterone concentrations reaching the blastocyst. Uteroglobin
is also  a  potent  inhibitor of phospholipase A2. It is a protein of 70 amino
acids that    form  antiparallel  disulfide-linked  dimers.  The progesterone-
binding site is formed by a cavity between the monomeric subunits. A schematic
representation of the location of the two disulfide  bonds in the antiparallel
dimer is shown below:

 NH2-xxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCx-COOH
       |                                                              |
 COOH-xCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxCxx-NH2

A number of proteins are known to be structurally related to uteroglobin:

 - Clara cell phospholipid-binding protein (CCPBP) (also known as CC10). CCPBP
   is a protein expressed by  non-ciliated cells  of  pulmonary airway surface
   epithelium. Its exact function  is  not  known.  Like uteroglobin, it is an
   inhibitor of   phospholipase   A2.   It   binds   to   phosphatidylcholine,
   phosphatidylinositol and to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) [2].
 - Domestic cat major allergen I chain 1 (fel DI) [3].
 - Human mammaglobin, a mammary-specific protein [4].
 - Rat prostatic steroid-binding protein C3 [5].

We derived  two  signature  patterns  specific to proteins that belong to this
family. These  are  centered  around  the  two  cysteine  residues involved in
interchain disulfide bonds.

 - The ADP,ATP carrier protein (AAC)  (ADP/ATP translocase)  which exports ATP
   into the  cytosol and  imports  ADP  into  the  mitochondrial  matrix.  The
   sequence of AAC has been obtained from various mammalian, plant  and fungal
   species.
 - The  2-oxoglutarate/malate    carrier    protein  (OGCP),  which    exports
   2-oxoglutarate into the cytosol and imports  malate  or  other dicarboxylic
   acids into  the  mitochondrial matrix. This protein plays an important role
   in several  metabolic  processes  such  as  the  malate/aspartate  and  the
   oxoglutarate/isocitrate shuttles.
 - The phosphate carrier protein, which transports  phosphate  groups from the
   cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix.
 - The brown fat uncoupling  protein (UCP) which dissipates  oxidative  energy
   into heat by transporting protons  from  the cytosol into the mitochondrial
   matrix.
 - The tricarboxylate transport  protein (or citrate transport  protein) which
   is involved   in  citrate-H+/malate  exchange.  It  is  important  for  the
   bioenergetics of  hepatic  cells  as  it provides a carbon source for fatty
   acid and sterol biosyntheses, and NAD for the glycolytic pathway.
 - The  Grave's  disease  carrier protein (GDC), a protein of unknown function
   recognized by IgG in patients with active Grave's disease.
 - Yeast mitochondrial proteins MRS3 and MRS4.  The exact  function  of  these
   proteins is not known. They suppress a mitochondrial splice defect  in  the
   first intron  of  the  COB  gene  and  may  act as carriers, exerting their
   suppressor activity    by   modulating   solute   concentrations   in   the
   mitochondrion.
 - Yeast mitochondrial FAD carrier protein (gene FLX1).
 - Yeast protein ACR1 [6],  which  seems  essential for  acetyl-CoA synthetase
   activity.
 - Yeast protein PET8.
 - Yeast protein PMT.
 - Yeast protein RIM2.
 - Yeast protein YHM1/SHM1.
 - Yeast protein YMC1.
 - Yeast protein YMC2.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins  YBR291c,  YEL006w, YER053c,  YFR045w, YHR002w,
   and YIL006w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein K11H3.3.

Two other  proteins  have  been  found  to  belong to this family, yet are not
localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane:

 - Maize amyloplast Brittle-1 protein. This protein, found in the endosperm of
   kernels, could play a role in amyloplast membrane transport.
 - Candida  boidinii  peroxisomal  membrane  protein  PMP47  [7].  PMP47 is an
   integral membrane  protein  of  the  peroxisome and it may play a role as a
   transporter.

These proteins all seem to be evolutionary related. Structurally, they consist
of three tandem repeats  of  a  domain of approximately  one hundred residues.
Each of  these  domains  contains  two  transmembrane  regions. As a signature
pattern, we selected one of the most conserved regions in the repeated domain,
located just after the first transmembrane region.

-Consensus pattern: P-x-[DE]-x-[LIVAT]-[RK]-x-[LRH]-[LIVMFY]-[QGAIVM]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for PMP47.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 115.    However,   in   all   these
 proteins, the pattern is found only ONCE  while it  is generally found two to
 three times in members of this family.

-Note: we are aware that this pattern is  becoming less and less stringent and
 are planning to complement it with a profile in the near future.

* Sugar transport proteins signatures *
***************************************

In mammalian  cells  the uptake of glucose is  mediated by a family of closely
related transport  proteins which are called the glucose transporters [1,2,3].
At least  seven of these transporters are  currently  known to exist (in Human
they are encoded by the GLUT1 to GLUT7 genes).

These integral membrane proteins  are  predicted  to  comprise twelve membrane
spanning domains.  The  glucose  transporters show sequence similarities [4,5]
with a number of other sugar or  metabolite transport  proteins  listed  below
(references are only provided for recently determined sequences).

 - Escherichia coli arabinose-proton symport (araE).
 - Escherichia coli galactose-proton symport (galP).
 - Escherichia coli and  Klebsiella pneumoniae  citrate-proton  symport  (also
   known as citrate utilization determinant) (gene cit).
 - Escherichia coli alpha-ketoglutarate permease (gene kgtP).
 - Escherichia coli proline/betaine transporter (gene proP) [6].
 - Escherichia coli xylose-proton symport (xylE).
 - Zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitated diffusion protein (gene glf).
 - Yeast high and low affinity glucose transport proteins (genes SNF3, HXT1 to
   HXT14).
 - Yeast galactose transporter (gene GAL2).
 - Yeast maltose permeases (genes MAL3T and MAL6T).
 - Yeast myo-inositol transporters (genes ITR1 and ITR2).
 - Yeast carboxylic acid transporter protein homolog JEN1.
 - Yeast inorganic phosphate transporter (gene PHO84).
 - Kluyveromyces lactis lactose permease (gene LAC12).
 - Neurospora crassa quinate transporter (gene Qa-y),  and Emericella nidulans
   quinate permease (gene qutD).
 - Chlorella hexose carrier (gene HUP1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana glucose transporter (gene STP1).
 - Spinach sucrose transporter.
 - Leishmania donovani transporters D1 and D2.
 - Leishmania enriettii probable transport protein (LTP).

 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YBR241c, YCR98c and YFL040w.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZK637.1.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical proteins yabE, ydjE and yhjE.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hypothetical proteins HI0281 and HI0418.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical proteins yxbC and yxdF.

It has been suggested [4]  that these transport proteins have evolved from the
duplication of  an  ancestral  protein  with  six  transmembrane regions, this
hypothesis is based on the conservation of two G-R-[KR] motifs.  The first one
is located  between  the second and third transmembrane domains and the second
one between transmembrane domains 8 and 9.

We have developed  two patterns  to  detect this family of proteins. The first
pattern is based on the G-R-[KR] motif; but because this motif is too short to
be  specific to  this  family  of  proteins, we  have derived a pattern from a
larger region  centered on the  second copy of this motif.  The second pattern
is based on a number of conserved residues which are located at the end of the
fourth transmembrane  segment  and in the short loop region between the fourth
and fifth segments.

In bacteria there are a number of families  of transport proteins that mediate
the intake  of a variety of  sugars  with the  concomitant  uptake of hydrogen
ions (proton  symporters) [1].  One of these families  is  composed [2] of the
following proteins:

These integral membrane proteins  are  predicted  to  comprise twelve membrane

transmembrane regions  for  the  first pattern and between the eight and ninth
for the second pattern.

A family  of  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  proteins  that  seem  to be mainly
involved in  the  intake  of  small  peptides with the concomitant uptake of a
proton has  been  recently  characterized  [1,2]. Proteins that belong to this
family are:

 - Fungal peptide transporter PTR2.
 - Mammalian intestine proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter PeptT1.
 - Mammalian kidney proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter PeptT2.
 - Drosophila opt1.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana  peptide transporters PTR2-A and PTR2-B (also known as
   the histidine transporting protein NTR1).
 - Arabidopsis thaliana proton-dependent nitrate/chlorate transporter CHL1.

* Amiloride-sensitive sodium channels signature *
*************************************************

Amiloride-sensitive sodium  channels  (ASC) [1,2,3] are  sodium permeable non-
voltage-sensitive ion  channels  inhibited  by  the  diuretic  amiloride. They
mediate the  electrodiffusion  of the luminal sodium (and water, which follows
osmotically) through  the apical membrane of epithelial cells. In vertebrates,
these channels  control  the reabsorption of sodium in kidney, colon, lung and
sweat glands.  They also play a role in taste perception. The ASC are composed
of three  homologous  subunits, called alpha, beta and gamma. A fourth subunit
(delta) can  replace  the  alpha  subunit [4]. The vertebrate ASC subunits are
homologous to    the   degenerins [5] of Caenorhabditis elegans: deg-1, del-1,
mec-4, mec-10  and  unc-8.  They  are  proteins  that  can be mutated to cause
neuronal degradation. They are also thought to form sodium channels.

This family also includes:

 - Mammalian  amiloride-sensitive  brain  sodium  channel BNAC1 (also known as
   degenerin channel  MDEG).  This  is  a cation channel permeable for sodium,
   potassium and lithium.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins C41C4.5, T28F4.2 and ZK770.1.

Structurally, the  proteins  that  belong  to this family consist of about 510
to 920  amino  acid  residues.  They  are  made of an intracellular N-terminus
region followed  by  a  transmembrane  domain,  a  large extracellular loop, a
second transmembrane segment and a C-terminal intracellular tail [6].

The signature  we  developed  to  pick  up  these  proteins corresponds to the
beginning of  a  conserved  cysteine-rich  region  (there  are  nine conserved
cysteines in a domain of about 65 residues) located at the C-terminal  part of
the extracellular loop.

It has  been shown [1] that integral membrane proteins that mediate the intake
of a  wide  variety  of  molecules  with the concomitant uptake of sodium ions
(sodium symporters)  can  be  grouped, on the basis of sequence and functional
similarities into  a number of distinct families. One of these families [2] is
known as   the  sodium:dicarboxylate  symporter  family  (SDF)  and  currently
consists of the following proteins:

 - Escherichia coli  proton-glutamate  symport   protein  (glutamate-aspartate
   carrier) (gene gltP).  GltP  is  a sodium-independent carrier for glutamate
   and aspartate.
 - Bacillus proton/sodium-glutamate symport protein (gene gltT or gltP).  GltT
   is a sodium-dependent carrier for glutamate and aspartate.
 - Rhizobium  and Escherichia coli C4-dicarboxylate carrier (gene dctA), which
   is responsible  for  the  transport  of  dicarboxylates  such as succinate,
   fumarate, and malate. In Rhizobium this transport system plays an important
   role in the energy supply of the legume symbionts.
 - Three different mammalian  sodium-dependent L-glutamate and aspartate high-
   affinity transporters  (also  known  as  excitatory amino acid transporters
   (EAAT)) [3,4,5].  These  brain  proteins  are essential for terminating the
   postsynaptic action of  glutamate  by rapidly removing  released  glutamate
   from the synaptic cleft.
 - EAAT-4,  a  mammalian  chloride-dependent  L-glutamate  and aspartate high-
   affinity transporter [6].
 - Mammalian neutral amino acid transporter (SATT), a brain protein that plays
   a role in the transport of alanine, cysteine, serine and threonine [7].
 - Mammalian  insulin-activated  amino  acid  transporter  (AAAT),  an adipose
   tissue protein  that transports serine and, to a lesser extent, alanine and
   glutamate [8].
 - Hypothetical   protein   ygjU   from   Escherichia  coli  and  HI1545,  the
   corresponding Haemophilus influenzae protein.

These transporters  are  proteins of  from 420 to 573  amino acids  which  are
highly hydrophobic and which probably contain  about 10 transmembrane regions.
As signature patterns, we selected two conserved regions. The first pattern is
located  in the  N-terminal section and  seems to include a hydrophilic region
between two transmembrane regions.  The second  pattern is  located  in the C-
terminal section.

It has  been shown [1] that integral membrane proteins that mediate the intake

(sodium symporters)  can  be  grouped, on the basis of sequence and functional
similarities into  a  number  of  distinct  families. One of these families is
known as the  sodium:galactoside symporter family (SGF) and currently consists
of the following proteins:

 - The  melibiose  carrier  (gene melB) from a variety of enterobacteria. This
   protein is  responsible  for  melibiose  transport  and is capable of using
   hydrogen, sodium, and lithium cations as coupling cations for cotransport.
 - The  lactose  permease from Lactobacillus (gene lacS or lacY). This protein
   is responsible  for  the transport of beta-galactosides into the cell, with
   the concomitant   export  of  a  proton.  It  consists of two domains; a N-
   terminal SGF  domain  and a C-terminal domain that resembles that of enzyme
   IIA of the PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system.
 - The raffinose permease from Pediococcus pentosaceus.  It also consists of a
   N-terminal SGF domain and a C-terminal IIA domain.
 - The glucuronide carrier (gene gusB or uidP) from Escherichia coli.
 - The xylose transporter (gene xylP) from Lactobacillus pentosus.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yagG.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yicJ.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihO.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihP.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein yjmB.
 - Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein ynaJ.

Like sugar transport  proteins, these integral membrane proteins are predicted
to comprise    twelve  membrane  spanning  domains.  As a signature pattern we
selected a  highly  conserved  region  which  is located in a cytoplasmic loop
between  the second  and third transmembrane regions.  This region starts with
a conserved  aspartate which has been shown [2], in melB, to  be important for
the activity of the protein.

* Sodium:neurotransmitter symporter family signatures and profile *
*******************************************************************

After their release by synapses the action  of  a  number of neurotransmitters
is  terminated  by  their   high  affinity   sodium-dependent   reuptake  into
presynaptic terminals  by specific transport proteins [1 to 4]. These proteins
are the  target of psychomotor stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine. All
these proteins  belong  to  a family, known [5] as the sodium:neurotransmitter
symporter family  (SNF),  that  also  include  some transporters that function
outside the  brain  and  carry  related molecules. The SNF family is currently
known to consist of transporters for:

 - Betaine (also transports GABA).
 - Choline.
 - Creatine.
 - Dopamine.
 - GABA (four different forms of GABA transporters have been characterized).
 - Glycine.
 - Noradrenaline.
 - Proline.
 - Serotonin (5HT).
 - Taurine.

 - Rat orphan transporter NTT4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical transporter T23G5.5.

 - Haemophilus hypothetical proteins HI0736 and HI1690.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical MJ1319.

These transporters  are glycoproteins of about 600 to 700 amino-acid residues.
The two  bacterial proteins are smaller (457 to 508 residues).  These proteins
seem to  contain 12 transmembrane domains and both termini are predicted to be
located in the cytoplasm.

As signature patterns for these proteins we have selected two highly conserved
regions. The first region spans the C-terminal part of the first transmembrane
domain, a short extracellular  loop,   and  the N-terminal part of  the second
transmembrane  domain.   The  second  region   is   located  in   the  largest
extracellular loop between the third  and fourth  transmembrane domains;  this
region  contains two conserved cysteines  that  could be involved in disulfide
bonds. We also developed a profile for this family of proteins.

opened by  membrane  stretch  force  and  may participate in the regulation of
osmotic pressure changes within the cell.

MscL is  a  protein  of  about  15  kD.  It  forms  a  channel  organized as a

As a  signature  pattern, we selected the best conserved region. It is located

It has been shown [1] that some proteins involved in the transport of aromatic
amino acids in Escherichia coli and related bacteria are evolutionary related;
these permeases are:

* Anion exchangers family signatures *
**************************************

Anion exchange is  a cellular  transport function  which  contributes  to  the
regulation  of  cell  pH  and  volume.   Anion  exchangers  are  a  family  of
functionally  related  proteins   that  contributes  to  these  properties  by
maintaining the intracellular level of  the two principal anions: chloride and
HCO3-.

The best characterized anion exchanger is the band 3 protein [1],  which is an
erythrocyte anion exchange membrane glycoprotein. Band 3 is a protein of about
900 amino acids which consists of a cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of about 400
residues and an  hydrophobic  C-terminal  section  of  about 500 residues that
contains at least ten transmembrane regions.   The cytoplasmic domain provides
binding sites for  cytoskeletal  proteins, while  the integral membrane domain
is responsible for anion transport.

Band 3 protein is specific to erythroid cells, at least two other proteins [2]
structurally  and  functionally  related  to band 3, are found in nonerythroid
tissues:

 - AE2 (or B3 related protein; B3RP), a protein of 1200  residues, which seems
   to be present  in a  variety  of cell types including lymphoid, kidney, and
   choroid plexus.
 - AE3, a protein of 1200 residues, which is specific to neurons.

Structurally AE2 and AE3 are very similar to band 3, the main difference being
an extension of some 300 residues of the N-terminal domain in AE2 and AE3.

We developed two signature  patterns for these proteins.  The first pattern is
based on a conserved stretch of sequence that contains four clustered positive
charged residues and which  is  located  at  the C-terminal extremity  of  the
cytoplasmic  domain,  just  before  the  first  transmembrane segment from the
integral  domain.  The  second  pattern  is  based  on the perfectly conserved
sequence of the  fifth transmembrane segment;  this segment contains a lysine,
which is the  covalent  binding  site for the isothiocyanate group of DIDS, an
inhibitor of anion exchange.

************************
* MIP family signature *
************************

Recently the sequence  of a number of  different proteins, that all seem to be
transmembrane channel proteins, has been found to be  highly related [1 to 4].
These proteins are listed below.

 - Mammalian major intrinsic protein (MIP). MIP is the major component of lens
   fiber gap junctions.  Gap junctions  mediate  direct  exchange  of ions and
   small molecule from one cell to another.
 - Mammalian  aquaporins  [5].  These  proteins  form  water-specific channels
   that provide the  plasma  membranes  of  red  cells and kidney proximal and
   collecting tubules  with  high  permeability  to  water, thereby permitting
   water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient.
 - Soybean nodulin-26, a major component of the peribacteroid membrane induced
   during nodulation in legume roots after Rhizobium infection.
 - Plants tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIP). There  are  various  isoforms of
   TIP: alpha (seed), gamma, Rt (root), and Wsi (water-stress induced).  These
   proteins may allow the diffusion of water, amino acids and/or peptides from
   the tonoplast interior to the cytoplasm.
 - Bacterial glycerol facilitator protein (gene glpF), which  facilitates  the
   movement of glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane.
 - Salmonella typhimurium propanediol diffusion facilitator (gene pduF).
 - Yeast FPS1, a glycerol uptake/efflux facilitator protein.
 - Drosophila neurogenic protein  'big brain' (bib).  This protein may mediate
   intercellular communication; it  may functions by allowing the transport of
   certain molecules(s) and thereby sending a signal for an  exodermal cell to
   become an epidermoblast instead of a neuroblast.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YFL054c.
 - A hypothetical protein from the pepX region of lactococcus lactis.

The MIP family proteins seem to  contain six transmembrane segments.  Computer
analysis shows that these  protein  probably  arose  by  a  tandem, intragenic
duplication event from an ancestral protein that contained three transmembrane
segments.  As a signature pattern we selected a well conserved region which is
located  in  a  probable  cytoplasmic  loop   between   the second  and  third
transmembrane regions.

****************************************************

The  outer membrane  of  Gram-negative bacteria acts as a molecular filter for
hydrophilic compounds.  Proteins, known as porins [1], are responsible for the
'molecular sieve' properties of the outer membrane.  Porins  form large water-
filled channels which allows the  diffusion  of hydrophilic molecules into the
periplasmic space. Some porins form general diffusion channels that allows any
solutes  up to  a certain  size (that size is known as the exclusion limit) to
cross the membrane, while other porins  are  specific for a solute and contain
a binding site for that solute inside the pores  (these are known as selective
porins).  As porins are the major outer membrane proteins,  they also serve as
receptor sites for the binding of phages and bacteriocins.

General diffusion porins generally assemble as  trimer in the membrane and the
transmembrane core of these proteins  is composed  exclusively of beta strands
[2]. It has been shown [3] that a  number  of general porins are  evolutionary
related, these porins are:

 - Enterobacteria phoE.
 - Enterobacteria ompC.
 - Enterobacteria ompF.
 - Enterobacteria nmpC.
 - Bacteriophage PA-2 LC.
 - Neisseria PI.A.
 - Neisseria PI.B.

As a  signature  pattern  we  selected  a  conserved  region,  located  in the
C-terminal part of these proteins, which spans two putative transmembrane beta
strands.

*********************
* Actins signatures *
*********************

Actins [1 to 4] are highly conserved contractile  proteins that are present in
all eukaryotic cells. In vertebrates there are three groups of actin isoforms:
alpha, beta and gamma.  The alpha actins are found in muscle tissues and are a
major constituent of the contractile apparatus.  The beta and gamma actins co-
exists in most cell  types as  components of the cytoskeleton and as mediators
of internal cell motility.  In plants [5]  there  are  many isoforms which are
probably involved  in  a  variety of  functions such as cytoplasmic streaming,
cell shape determination,  tip growth,  graviperception, cell wall deposition,
etc.

Actin exists either in a monomeric form (G-actin) or in a polymerized form (F-
actin). Each actin monomer  can  bind a molecule of ATP;  when  polymerization
occurs, the ATP is hydrolyzed.

Actin is a protein of from 374 to 379 amino acid  residues.  The  structure of
actin has been highly conserved in the course of evolution.

Recently some  divergent  actin-like  proteins have been identified in several
species. These proteins are:

 - Centractin  (actin-RPV)  from mammals, fungi (yeast ACT5, Neurospora crassa
   ro-4) and  Pneumocystis  carinii  (actin-II).  Centractin  seems  to  be  a
   component of  a  multi-subunit  centrosomal complex involved in microtubule
   based vesicle motility. This subfamily is also known as ARP1.
 - ARP2  subfamily  which  includes  chicken ACTL, yeast ACT2, Drosophila 14D,
   C.elegans actC.
 - ARP3  subfamily  which includes actin 2 from mammals, Drosophila 66B, yeast
   ACT4 and fission yeast act2.
 - ARP4  subfamily  which includes yeast ACT3 and Drosophila 13E.

We developed  three  signature  patterns. The first two are specific to actins
and span  positions  54 to 64 and 357 to 365. The last signature picks up both
actins and  the actin-like proteins and corresponds to positions 106 to 118 in
actins.

**************************************
* Annexins repeated domain signature *
**************************************

Annexins [1  to 6]  are a   group  of calcium-binding  proteins that associate
reversibly  with membranes.   They  bind   to  phospholipid   bilayers  in the
presence  of micromolar free calcium  concentration.   The binding is specific
for calcium and for acidic phospholipids.  Annexins  have  been  claimed to be
involved in cytoskeletal interactions, phospholipase inhibition, intracellular
signalling, anticoagulation, and membrane fusion.

Each of these  proteins  consist  of  an  N-terminal domain of variable length
followed by four or eight copies of a conserved segment of sixty one residues.
The repeat (sometimes known  as  an 'endonexin fold')  consists of five alpha-
helices that are wound into a right-handed superhelix [7].

The proteins known to belong to the annexin family are listed below:

 - Annexin I (Lipocortin 1) (Calpactin 2) (p35) (Chromobindin 9).
 - Annexin II (Lipocortin 2) (Calpactin 1) (Protein I) (p36) (Chromobindin 8).
 - Annexin III (Lipocortin 3) (PAP-III).
 - Annexin IV (Lipocortin 4) (Endonexin I) (Protein II) (Chromobindin 4).
 - Annexin V (Lipocortin 5) (Endonexin 2) (VAC-alpha) (Anchorin CII) (PAP-I).
 - Annexin VI (Lipocortin 6) (Protein III) (Chromobindin 20) (p68) (p70). This
   is the only known annexin that contains 8 (instead of 4) repeats.
 - Annexin VII (Synexin).
 - Annexin VIII (Vascular anticoagulant-beta) (VAC-beta).
 - Annexin IX from Drosophila.

Caveolins [1,2]  are  a  family  of  integral  membrane proteins which are the
principal components  of  caveolae membranes. Cavoleae are flask-shaped plasma
membrane invaginations  whose  exact  cellular  function  is  not  yet  clear.
Caveolins may  act  as  scaffolding  proteins  within caveolar membranes. They
interact directly  with G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate
their activity.

Currently, three  different  forms  of  caveolins  are  known:  caveolin-1 (or
VIP21), caveolin-2 and caveolin-3 (or M-caveolin).

Caveolins are  proteins  of  about  20 Kd, they form high molecular mass homo-
oligomers. Structurally   they  seem  to  have  a  N-terminal  and  C-terminal
hydrophilic segments  and  a  long central transmembrane domains that probably
forms an  hairpin  in  the  membrane.  Both  extremities are known to face the
cytoplasm.

As a  signature  pattern, we selected a perfectly conseerved octapeptide which
is located in the N-terminal section of caveolins.

* Clathrin light chains signatures *
************************************

Clathrin [1,2] is the major coat-forming  protein  that encloses vesicles such
as coated pits and forms cell  surface  patches  involved  in membrane traffic
within eukaryotic cells.  The clathrin coats (called triskelions) are composed
of three heavy chains (180 Kd) and three light chains (23 to 27 Kd).

The clathrin light chains [3], which  may help to properly orient the assembly
and disassembly of the clathrin coats, bind non-covalently to the heavy chain,
they also bind calcium and interact with the hsc70 uncoating ATPase.

 - In higher eukaryotes two genes code  for distinct but related light chains:
   LC(a) and LC(b).  Each  of  the  two  genes  can  yield, by tissue-specific
   alternative splicing, two separate forms which differ by the insertion of a
   sequence of respectively  thirty or eighteen residues.  There is, in the N-
   terminal part of the clathrin light chains  a  domain  of  twenty one amino
   acid residues which is perfectly conserved in LC(a) and LC(b).
 - In yeast there is a single light chain (gene CLC1)  whose  sequence is only
   distantly related to that of higher eukaryotes.

We developed two signature  patterns  for  clathrin  light  chains.  The first
pattern is a  heptapeptide from the center of the  conserved N-terminal region
of eukaryotic light chains;  the  second  pattern is derived from a positively
charged region located in the C-terminal extremity of all known clathrin light
chains.

* Clusterin signatures *
************************

Clusterin is a vertebrate glycoprotein [1]  which  is  known by various names:

 - In Human as complement-associated  protein SP-40,40,  complement  cytolysis
   inhibitor (CLI), NA1/NA2, and apolipoprotein J (Apo-J).
 - In rat as sulfated glycoprotein 2 (SGP-2), dimeric acid glycoprotein (DAG),
   and Testosterone Repressed Prostate Message-2 (TRPM-2).
 - In bovine as glycoprotein III (GP-III).
 - In dog as glycoprotein 80 (gp-80).
 - In quail as protein T64.

The exact function  of  this  protein  is  not  yet  clear,  it is known to be
expressed in a variety of tissues and  it  seems  to be able to bind to cells,
membranes, and hydrophobic proteins.  It has  been  associated with programmed
cell death.

Clusterin is  synthesized as a precursor polypeptide of about 400  amino acids
which is post-translationally cleaved to form two subunits (of about 200 amino
acids each).  The  two  subunits are linked by five disulfide bonds to form an
antiparallel ladder-like structure [2]. In  each of  the  mature  subunits the
five cysteines that are  involved  in disulfide bonds are clustered in domains
of about 30 amino acids located in the central part of the subunits.

We have developed two signature patterns for clusterin, each  of them contains
three cysteines, the first pattern is  derived  from  the  N-terminal  subunit
cluster and the second pattern is derived from the C-terminal subunit cluster.

* Connexins signatures *
************************

Gap junctions [1] are specialized regions of the plasma membrane which consist
of closely  packed  pairs  of  transmembrane  channels, the connexons, through
which small molecules diffuse from a cell to a neighboring cell. Each connexon
is composed  of  an  hexamer  of  an  integral membrane protein which is often
referred to  as  connexin. In a given species there are a number of different,
yet structurally  related,  tissue specific, forms of connexins.  The types of
connexins which are currently known are listed below.

 - Connexin 56   (Cx56).
 - Connexin 50   (Cx50)   (lens fiber protein MP70).
 - Connexin 46   (Cx46)   (alpha-3).
 - Connexin 45   (Cx45)   (alpha-6).
 - Connexin 43   (Cx43)   (alpha-1).
 - Connexin 40   (Cx40)   (alpha-5).
 - Connexin 38   (Cx38)   (alpha-2).
 - Connexin 37   (Cx37)   (alpha-4).
 - Connexin 33   (Cx33)   (alpha-7).
 - Connexin 32   (Cx32)   (beta-1).
 - Connexin 31.1 (Cx31.1) (beta-4).
 - Connexin 31   (Cx31)   (beta-3).
 - Connexin 30.3 (Cx30.3) (beta-5).
 - Connexin 26   (Cx26)   (beta-2).

Structurally the connexins  consist of a  short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain,
followed by four  transmembrane  segments  that delimit  two extracellular and
one cytoplasmic loops; the C-terminal domain is cytoplasmic  and its length is
variable  (from 20 residues in Cx26  to  260 residues in Cx56).  The schematic
representation of this structure is shown below.

       NH2-***        ***          *************-COOH

                **           **

The sequences of the two extracellular loops are well conserved. In both loops
there are three conserved cysteines which are involved in disulfide bonds.  We
have built signature patterns from each of these two loop regions.

* Crystallins beta and gamma 'Greek key' motif signature *
**********************************************************

Crystallins are  the dominant structural components of the eye lens. Among the
different type of crystallins, the beta and gamma crystallins form a family of
related  proteins [1,2]. Structurally, beta and gamma crystallins are composed
of two similar domains which, in turn, are each composed of two similar motifs
with the  two domains  connected  by  a  short connecting peptide. Each motif,
which  is about  forty  amino  acid  residues long, is folded in a distinctive
'Greek key' pattern.

Apart from  the different types  of  beta and  gamma crystallins, this  family
also includes the following proteins:

 - Two related proteins  from  the  sporulating  bacterium Myxococcus xanthus:
   protein S, a calcium-binding protein  that  forms a major part of the spore
   coat, and a close homolog of protein S.
 - Spherulin 3a from the slime mold  Physarum polycephalum.  Spherulin 3a is a
   development specific  protein  synthesized in  response to various kinds of
   stress leading to encystment and dormancy.  The  sequence  of  Spherulin 3a
   consists of two 'Greek key' motifs [3].

The pattern we developed for this family of proteins span positions 3 to 18 of
the Greek-key motif and includes three conserved positions which are important
for the  structural integrity  of the motif.  These are the conserved aromatic
residues in positions 6 and 11 of the motif and the glycine in position 13.

****************************
* Dynamin family signature *
****************************

Dynamin [1,2] is  a  microtubule-associated force-producing  protein of 100 Kd
which is involved in  the  production of microtubule bundles and which is able
to bind and hydrolyze GTP.  Dynamin  is structurally related  to the following
proteins:

 - Drosophila shibire  protein (gene shi) [3].  Shibire is, very probably, the
   Drosophila cognate of mammalian dynamin.  It seems to provide the motor for
   vesicular transport during endocytosis.
 - Yeast vacuolar  sorting protein VPS1 (or SPO15) [4], a protein which  could
   also be involved in microtubule-associated motility.
 - Yeast  protein  MGM1  [5],  which  is  required  for  mitochondrial  genome
   maintenance.
 - Yeast protein DNM1, which is involved in endocytosis.
 - Interferon induced Mx proteins [6,7].  Interferon alpha  or beta induce the
   synthesis of a family of closely related proteins.  Most  of these proteins
   are known to confer resistance to influenza viruses and/or rhabdoviruses on
   transfected mammalian cell in culture.

The  three  motifs  found  in  all  GTP-binding proteins are located in the N-
terminal part of these proteins.   The signature pattern that we developed for
these proteins  is  based  on  a  highly  conserved  region  downstream of the
ATP/GTP-binding motif 'A' (P-loop) (see <PDOC00017>).

Dynein is  a  multisubunit microtubule-dependent motor enzyme that acts as the
force generating  protein  of  eukaryotic  cilia and flagella. The cytoplasmic
isoform of dynein acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of
vesicles and organelles along microtubules.  Dynein is composed of a number of
ATP-binding large subunits, intermediate size subunits and small subunits.

Among the small subunits, there is a family [1,2] of highly conserved proteins
which consist of:

  - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagellar outer arm dynein 8 Kd and 11 Kd  light
    chains.
  - Higher eukaryotes cytoplasmic dynein light chain 1.
  - Yeast cytoplasmic dynein light chain 1 (gene DYN2 or SLC1).
  - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical dynein light chains M18.2 and T26A5.9.

These proteins  are  have  from 89 to 120 amino acids. As a signature pattern,

* FtsZ protein signatures *
***************************

In bacteria,  ftsZ   [1,2] is  an  essential cell division protein involved in
cytokinesis. It assembles into a ring on the inner surface  of the cytoplasmic
membrane at the place where division will occur. The ring serves as a scaffold
that is  disassembled  when  septation  is  completed.  FtsZ  is a GTP binding
protein with a GTPase activity. It undergoes GTP-dependent polymerization into
filaments (or  tubules)  that  seem  to form a cytoskeleton involved in septum
synthesis.

FtsZ is  a  protein  of  about  400  residues  which  is well conserved across
bacterial species  and  which is also present in the chloroplast of plants [3]
as well  as  in archaebacteria  [4].  FtsZ  shows  a  limited  similarity with
eukaryotic tubulins.   This  similarity  is  probably  both  evolutionary  and
functionally significant.

As signature  patterns  we  selected  two  glycine-rich conserved regions. The
second region  is  equivalent  to  the  GTP-binding  region  of  tubulins (see
<PDOC00199>).

* Intermediate filaments signature *
************************************

Intermediate filaments   (IF)   [1,2,3]  are  proteins  which  are  primordial
components of  the cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope.  They generally form
filamentous structures  8  to  14  nm  wide. IF proteins are members of a very
large multigene  family  of  proteins  which has been subdivided in five major
subgroups:

 - Type   I: Acidic cytokeratins.
 - Type  II: Basic cytokeratins.
 - Type III: Vimentin,  desmin,   glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein   (GFAP),
   peripherin, and plasticin.
 - Type  IV: Neurofilaments L, H and M, alpha-internexin and nestin.
 - Type   V: Nuclear lamins A, B1, B2 and C.

All IF proteins  are structurally  similar in  that they consist of: a central
rod domain comprising  some 300 to  350 residues which is  arranged in coiled-
coiled alpha-helices,  with at least two short characteristic interruptions; a
N-terminal non-helical  domain  (head)  of variable  length; and a  C-terminal
domain (tail)  which is also   non-helical,  and which   shows  extreme length
variation between different IF proteins.

While IF proteins are evolutionary and structurally related, they have limited
sequence homologies  except in several regions of the rod domain. We use, as a
sequence pattern  for  this  class of  proteins,  a conserved  region  at  the
C-terminal extremity of the rod domain.

* Involucrin signature *
************************

Involucrin [1,2] is a protein present in keratinocytes of epidermis and other
stratified squamous epithelia.  Involucrin  first appears in the cell cytosol,
but ultimately  becomes cross-linked  to membrane proteins by transglutaminase
thus helping in  the  formation  of  an  insoluble envelope beneath the plasma
membrane.

Structurally  involucrin consists of a conserved region of about 75 amino acid
residues  followed  by  two  extremely  variable length segments  that contain
glutamine-rich tandem repeats. The  glutamine  residues  in the tandem repeats
are the substrate for the tranglutaminase in the cross-linking reaction.   The
total size of the protein  varies  from  285 residues (in dog) to 835 residues
(in orangutan).

The signature pattern for  involucrin  corresponds to the N-terminal extremity
of the protein,

**********************************************
* Kinesin motor domain signature and profile *
**********************************************

Kinesin [1,2,3] is a  microtubule-associated  force-producing protein that may
play a role in organelle transport.  Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed
of two  heavy  chains  and  two  light  chains.  The kinesin motor activity is
directed toward the microtubule's plus end.

The heavy  chain is  composed of three structural domains: a large globular N-
terminal domain  which is responsible for the motor activity of kinesin (it is
known to  hydrolyze  ATP,  to bind and move on microtubules), a central alpha-
helical coiled  coil  domain that mediates the heavy chain dimerization; and a
small globular  C-terminal domain which interacts with other proteins (such as
the kinesin light chains), vesicles and membranous organelles.

A number of proteins have been  recently  found that contain a  domain similar
to that of the kinesin 'motor' domain [1,4,E1]:

 - Drosophila claret segregational protein (ncd).   Ncd is required for normal
   chromosomal  segregation  in  meiosis, in females,  and  in  early  mitotic
   divisions of the embryo.  The  ncd  motor  activity  is directed toward the
   microtubule's minus end.
 - Drosophila kinesin-like protein (nod). Nod is required for the distributive
   chromosome segregation of nonexchange chromosomes during meiosis.
 - Human CENP-E [4]. CENP-E is a protein  that  associates  with  kinetochores
   during   chromosome  congression,  relocates  to  the   spindle  midzone at
   anaphase, and is quantitatively discarded at the end of the cell division.
   CENP-E is probably an important  motor molecule in chromosome movement and/
   or spindle elongation.
 - Human  mitotic  kinesin-like  protein-1  (MKLP-1),  a  motor  protein whose
   activity is directed toward the microtubule's plus end.
 - Yeast KAR3 protein,  which  is  essential  for  yeast nuclear fusion during
   mating. KAR3 may  mediate  microtubule  sliding  during  nuclear fusion and
   possibly mitosis.
 - Yeast  CIN8  and  KIP1  proteins which are required for the assembly of the
   mitotic spindle.  Both proteins  seem to interact with spindle microtubules
   to produce an outwardly directed force acting upon the poles.
 - Fission yeast cut7 protein, which is essential for spindle body duplication
   during mitotic division.
 - Emericella  nidulans  bimC,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  nuclear
   division.
 - Emericella nidulans klpA.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans unc-104, which may  be required for the transport of
   substances needed for neuronal cell differentiation.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans osm-3.
 - Xenopus Eg5, which may be involved in mitosis.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana KatA, KatB and katC.
 - Chlamydomonas reinhardtii FLA10/KHP1 and KLP1. Both proteins seem to play a
   role in the rotation or twisting of the microtubules of the flagella.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09A5.2.

The kinesin motor  domain  is  located  in  the N-terminal part of most of the
above proteins,  with the exception of KAR3, klpA, and ncd where it is located
in the C-terminal section.

The kinesin motor domain contains about  330 amino acids. An ATP-binding motif
of type A is found  near position 80 to 90,  the C-terminal half of the domain
is involved in microtubule-binding.  The  signature pattern for that domain is
derived from a conserved decapeptide inside the microtubule-binding part.

Kinesin [1]  is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that may play
a role  in  organelle  transport. Kinesin is an oligomeric complex composed of
two heavy  chains  and  two light chains. The light chain has been proposed to
function in  the  coupling of cargo to the heavy chain or in the modulation of
its ATPase activity [2]. It is a well conserved protein which is composed of a
core that  consist of a coiled-coil domain followed  by  four imperfect tandem
repeats of  a  42  residue  domain. The N- and C-termini are more variable and
alternative splicing is responsible for the production of isoforms that differ
in those two regions.

We developed a signature pattern that span the complete length of the repeated
segment.

**********************************

Myelin basic protein (MBP) [1,2] is an important hydrophilic protein which may
function to maintain proper structure of myelin.  MBP  interacts  with  myelin
lipids both electrostatically and by hydrophobic interactions.

In mammals various forms of  MBP exist which  are  produced by the alternative
splicing of a single gene; these forms  differ  by the presence or the absence
of short (10 to 20 residues)  peptides  in  various  internal locations in the
sequence.  The  major form of MBP is generally a protein of about 18.5 Kd (170
residues).

MBP is the target of many post-translational modifications: it is N-terminally
acetylated,  methylated  on  an  arginine residue, phosphorylated  by  various
serine/threonine protein-kinases, and deamidated on some glutamine residues.

As a signature  pattern  for MBP we selected  the  best  conserved part of the
protein, a perfectly conserved heptapeptide.

P0 is a protein of about  28 Kd  that  consists of three domains: a N-terminal

P0 is well conserved  across species.  As  a  signature  pattern we selected a

* Myelin proteolipid protein signatures *
*****************************************

Myelin proteolipid protein (PLP or lipophilin) [1] is the major myelin protein
from the central nervous system (CNS).  It probably plays an important role in
the formation  or maintenance of the multilamellar structure of myelin. In man
point mutations in PLP  are  the  cause of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD),
a neurologic disorder of myelin metabolism. In animals dismyelinating diseases
such as mouse 'jimpy' (jp),  rat md,  or dog 'shaking pup' are  also caused by
mutations in PLP.

PLP is  a  highly conserved [2] hydrophobic protein of 276 to 280 amino  acids
which seems to contain  four transmembrane   segments, two disulfide bonds and
which covalently binds lipids (at least six palmitate groups in mammals) [3].

PLP is highly related to M6, a neuronal membrane glycoprotein [4].

As signature  patterns  for these proteins, we selected two conserved regions.
The first pattern is located in the N-terminal region; at the extremity of the
first transmembrane region. The second pattern is located in the extracellular
loop between  the  last  two  transmembrane regions  and  contains  a cysteine
involved in a disulfide bond.

Neuromodulin (also known as GAP-43, pp46, B-50, F1, and P-57) [1] is an axonal
membrane protein associated with nerve growth.  It is a major component of the
motile growth cones that form the tips of elongating axons. Neuromodulin is an
hydrophilic protein of 210 to 240 amino acid residues,  which binds calmodulin
and  inhibits  phosphatidylinositol  phosphate  kinase  (PIP kinase).    It is
phosphorylated by protein  kinase C,  and regulates the binding of GTP to G(0)
[2]. Neuromodulin contains an IQ motif (see <PDOC50096>).

Two functionally important  regions  of GAP-43 have been characterized: the N-
terminal  extremity of  the protein  contains two cysteine residues  which are
palmitoylated  and  are  responsible  for the attachment of the protein to the
membrane; about forty residues downstream  is  a serine  residue  which can be
phosphorylated  by  protein  kinase C [3]  and   which  is  adjacent  to   the
calmodulin-binding domain.  We have  selected  those two regions as  signature
patterns.

Peripherin (or  RDS)  and rom-1 are related retinal-specific integral membrane
proteins which  are located at the rims of the photoreceptor disks, where they
may act  jointly  in  disk  morphogenesis  [1]. Both peripherin and rom-1 form
disulfide-linked homodimers.

Defects in  the  peripherin  gene  (RDS)  cause various Human diseases such as
autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, autosomal dominant punctata albescens
and butterfly-shaped pigment dystrophy. In mice it causes retinopathy known as
'retinal degeneration slow' (rds).

These proteins  contain  about  350  amino  acid  residues.  Structurally they
consist of   a   short   cytoplasmic   N-terminal  domain,  followed  by  four
transmembrane segments that delimit two lumenal and one cytoplasmic loops; the
C-terminal domain is cytoplasmic. The second lumenal loop is very large (about

* Synapsins signatures *
************************

Synapsins [1,2] are neuronal phosphoproteins that coat synaptic vesicles, bind
to several elements of  the cytoskeleton (including actin filaments),  and are
believed to function in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.

The synapsin family currently includes  the highly related  synapsin I and II.
Both synapsins exists in  two  alternatively spliced variants: IA and IB;  IIA
and IIB, which only differ in their carboxy-termini. It also includes synapsin
III.

Structurally synapsin IA/IB consist of a small N-terminal domain  (referred to
as the 'A' domain) that contains a  serine residue which serves as an acceptor
site for phosphorylation by both cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+,
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I.  The 'A' domain is followed by a linker
domain ('B') of some 80 residues.  The third domain ('C'), which  contains 300
amino acids, is  implicated  in the binding to actin and to synaptic vesicles.
The fourth domain 'D' is proline-rich and contains about 250 residues. Finally
the C-terminal spliced  domain  is known as 'E' (in IA), or 'F' (in IB).   The
structure of synapsin IIA/IIB also consists of  the 'A', 'B', and 'C' domains,
the 'D' domain is replaced by smaller  proline-rich region ('G'). Synapsin IIB
ends  with a small domain ('I'),  while the  larger C-terminal of synapsin IIA
consist of two  domains: 'H'  and 'E' (homologous to the 'E' of IA). A diagram
of the domains structure of the four synapsins is shown below.

***************************
* Synaptobrevin signature *
***************************

Synaptobrevin [1] is an intrinsic membrane  protein of small synaptic vesicles
whose function is  not  yet known, but  which is highly  conserved in mammals,
electric ray  (where  its  is  known as VAMP-1),  Drosophila and yeast [2]. In
yeast there  are  two  closely  related forms of synaptobrevin (genes SNC1 and
SNC2) while in mammals there is at least 4 (genes SYB1, SYB2, SYB3 and SYBL1).

Structurally synaptobrevin  consist of a N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of from
90 to 110 residues,  followed  by  a transmembrane region, and then by a short
(from 2 to 22 residues) C-terminal intravesicular domain.

As a  signature  pattern  for  synaptobrevin  we  selected  a highly conserved
stretch of residues located in the central part of the sequence.

Tropomyosins [1,2] are family of closely  related  proteins  present in muscle
and non-muscle cells. In striated muscle, tropomyosin mediate the interactions
between the  troponin  complex and actin so as to regulate muscle contraction.
The role of tropomyosin in smooth muscle  and non-muscle tissues is not clear.
Tropomyosin is an alpha-helical protein that forms a coiled-coil dimer.

Muscle isoforms of tropomyosin are  characterized  by  having  284  amino acid
residues and a highly  conserved N-terminal  region,  whereas non-muscle forms
are generally smaller and are heterogeneous in their N-terminal region.

The signature pattern for tropomyosins  is based on a very conserved region in

* Tubulin subunits alpha, beta, and gamma signature *
*****************************************************

Tubulins [1,2], the major  constituent of  microtubules  are dimeric  proteins
which consist of two closely related subunits (alpha and  beta). Tubulin binds
two molecules of GTP at two different sites (N and E). At the E (Exchangeable)
site, GTP is  hydrolyzed during incorporation into the microtubule. Near the E
site is an invariant region rich in glycines which is found in both chains and
which is now [3]  said to control the access of the nucleotide  to its binding
site. We developed a signature pattern from this region.

With the exception of the simple eukaryotes, most species express a variety of
closely related alpha and beta isotypes.

In most species there is a third member  of the tubulin family: gamma tubulin.
Gamma tubulin is  found at  microtubule  organizing centers (MTOC) such as the
spindle poles or the centrosome, suggesting that it  is involved in the minus-
end nucleation of microtubule assembly [4].

*******************************************
* Tubulin-beta mRNA autoregulation signal *

The stability of beta-tubulin mRNAs are autoregulated by their own translation
product [1].  Unpolymerized  tubulin  subunits  bind  directly  (or activate a
factor(s) which binds  co-translationally)  to the nascent N-terminus of beta-
tubulin. This binding is transduced through the adjacent ribosomes to activate
an RNAse that degrades the polysome-bound mRNA.    The recognition element has
been shown to be  the first four amino acids of beta-tubulin: Met-Arg-Glu-Ile.
Mutations to this sequence abolish the  autoregulation effect  (except for the
replacement of Glu by Asp);  transposition of  this sequence  to  an  internal
region of a polypeptide also suppresses the autoregulatory effect.

been   classified into  two  classes:  high   molecular  weight  MAP's and Tau
protein. These   proteins   promote   microtubule   assembly   and   stabilize
microtubules. The  C-terminal  region of  a  subset of these proteins contains
three or four tandem repeats  of a conserved domain of about thirty amino acid

 - MAP2 [2], a neuronal member of the high molecular weight MAP's.
 - MAP4 [3], a non-neuronal member of the high molecular weight MAP's. MAP4 is

******************************
* Vinculin family signatures *
******************************

Vinculin [1] is  a eukaryotic  protein  that  seems  to  be  involved  in  the
attachment of the actin-based microfilaments to the plasma membrane.  Vinculin
is located  at  the cytoplasmic  side  of  focal contacts or adhesion plaques.
In addition to actin, vinculin interacts  with  other structural proteins such
as talin and alpha-actinins.

Vinculin is a large protein of 116 Kd (about a 1000 residues).    Structurally
the protein  consists of an  acidic N-terminal domain of about 90 Kd separated
from a basic C-terminal  domain  of  about  25 Kd by  a proline-rich region of
about 50 residues.  The  central part of  the  N-terminal domain consists of a
variable number (3 in vertebrates, 2 in Caenorhabditis elegans)  of repeats of
a 110 amino acids domain.

Catenins [2] are  proteins  that  associate with  the  cytoplasmic domain of a
variety of cadherins. The  association  of  catenins to  cadherins  produces a
complex which is linked  to the actin filament network, and which  seems to be
of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion properties.  Three different
types  of  catenins seem to exist: alpha, beta, and gamma.  Alpha-catenins are
proteins of about 100 Kd which  are  evolutionary  related  to  vinculin.   In
term of their structure  the most significant  differences are the absence, in
alpha-catenin, of the repeated domain and of the proline-rich segment.

We developed two signature patterns  for  this family of proteins.   The first
pattern is located in the  N-terminal  section  of  both  vinculin  and alpha-
catenins and is part, in vinculin, of a domain that seems to be  involved with
the interaction with talin.  The second pattern is based on a conserved region
in the N-terminal part of the repeated domain of vinculin.

* Amyloidogenic glycoprotein signatures *

Amyloidogenic glycoprotein  (A4  protein or APP)  is an integral, glycosylated
membrane brain   protein  [1,2,E1,E2].  APP  is  associated  with  Alzheimer's
disease (AD). This responsibility stems from the fact that a small peptide (of
43 residues), called  the  amyloid beta protein, which is part of the sequence
of A4,  is  the  major  constituent  of  amyloid  deposits in AD and in Down's
syndrome. As  shown  in  the schematic representation below,  the amyloid beta
protein both precedes and forms part of the unique transmembrane region of A4.

       |  Extracellular                         XXXXXXX Cytoplasmic |
       +------------------------------------BBBBBBBBxxx-------------+

'X': Transmembrane region.
'B': Position of the amyloid beta protein in A4.

The exact function of A4 protein  is not  yet known, but it has been suggested
that it mediates cell-cell interactions.  The sequence  of  A4  from mammalian
species is well conserved and is also similar to that of other proteins:

 - Drosophila APPL (gene vnd) [3].
 - Mammalian protein APLP1 [4].
 - Mammalian protein APLP2 (APPH) (YWK-II) (CDEI-binding protein) [5].

We have derived  two  patterns specific to these proteins,  the first one is a
perfectly conserved octapeptide  located in the beginning of the extracellular
domain; the second is a conserved octapeptide located at the C-terminal end of
the cytoplasmic domain.

*****************************************
* Cadherin domain signature and profile *
*****************************************

Cadherins [1,2] are a family of animal glycoproteins responsible for  calcium-
dependent  cell-cell   adhesion.    Cadherins  preferentially   interact  with
themselves in  a  homophilic  manner  in connecting cells; thus acting as both
receptor and  ligand.  A wide number of tissue-specific forms of cadherins are
known, for example:

 - Epithelial (E-cadherin) (CDH1).
 - Neural (N-cadherin) (CDH2).
 - Placental (P-cadherin) (CDH3).
 - Retinal (R-cadherin) (CDH4).
 - Vascular endothelial (VE-cadherin) (CDH5).
 - Kidney (K-cadherin) (CDH6).
 - Cadherin-8 (CDH8).
 - Cadherin-9 (CDH9).
 - Osteoblast (OB-cadherin) (CDH11).
 - Brain (BR-cadherin) (CDH12).
 - T-cadherin (truncated cadherin) (CDH13).
 - Muscle (M-cadherin) (CDH15).
 - Kidney (Ksp-cadherin) (CDH16).
 - Liver-intestine (LI-cadherin) (CDH17).

Structurally, cadherins are built of the following domains: a signal sequence,
followed by a propeptide  of about 130 residues,  then an extracellular domain
of around 600 residues, then a transmembrane region,  and finally a C-terminal
cytoplasmic domain of about 150 residues. The extracellular domain can be sub-
divided into five parts: there are four repeats of about 110 residues followed
by a region that contains four conserved cysteines.   It is suggested that the
calcium-binding region of cadherins is located in the extracellular repeats.

Cadherins are  evolutionary  related to the desmogleins which are component of
intercellular desmosome  junctions  involved  in  the  interaction  of  plaque
proteins:

 - Desmoglein 1 (desmosomal glycoprotein I).
 - Desmoglein 2.
 - Desmoglein 3 (Pemphigus vulgaris antigen).

Other proteins that include cadherin domains are:

 - Drosophila  fat  protein  [3], a huge protein of over 5000 amino acids that
   contains 34  cadherin-like repeats in its extracellular domain. Homologs of
   fat are found in mammals.
 - Protocadherins (6 copies).
 - Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor ret (1 copy).

The signature pattern we have developed for the  repeated domain is located in
it the  C-terminal extremity which is its best conserved region.  The  pattern
includes two  conserved    aspartic  acid residues as well as two asparagines;
these residues  could  be  implicated  in the binding of calcium. We have also
developed a profile that spans the complete domain.

-Note: this pattern is found  in the first,  second, and fourth  copies of the

-Note: this documentation  entry  is linked  to both a signature pattern and a

* Gas vesicles protein GVPa signatures *
****************************************

Gas vesicles are small, hollow, gas filled protein structures found in several
cyanobacterial  and archaebacterial     microorganisms  [1].  They  allow  the
positioning of  the  bacteria  at the favorable depth for growth. Gas vesicles
are hollow    cylindrical tubes, closed by a hollow, conical cap  at each end.
Both the    conical  end caps and central cylinder are made  up of 4-5 nm wide
ribs that  run at right angles to the long axis of the structure. Gas vesicles
seem to be constituted of two different protein components: GVPa and GVPc.

GVPa, a small protein of about 70 amino acid residues, is the main constituent
of gas vesicles and form the essential core of the structure.  The sequence of
GVPa is extremely well conserved.

GvpJ and  gvpM,  two proteins encoded in the cluster of genes required for gas
vesicle synthesis  in  the archaebacteria Halobacterium halobium and Haloferax
mediterranei, have  been  found  [2]  to  be evolutionary related to GVPa. The
exact  function of  these    two proteins is not known, although they could be
important for determining the shape determination gas vesicles.

The N-terminal  domain  of  Aphanizomenon  flos-aquae  protein  gvpA/J is also
related to GVPa.

We developed two  signature  patterns for this family of proteins.  The  first
pattern  is located in the N-terminal  section while  the  second is in the C-
terminal section.

tandem repeats  of  a 33  residue  sequence  flanked by sequences of 18 and 10
residues at the N- and C-termini, respectively.

We derived a  signature pattern for the repeated domain.  This signature spans
positions 11 to 33 of that domain.

A family  of  small bacterial proteins has been recently discovered [1,2] that
seem to  be  involved  in  the formation of specific microcompartiments in the
cell in  which  the  metabolism  of potentially toxic by-products takes place.
The proteins that belong to this family are:

 - Escherichia   coli   and  Salmonella  typhimurium  cchA,  involved  in  the
   degradation of ethanolamine.
 - Salmonella typhimurium pduA, involved in 1,2-propanediol metabolism.
 - Synechococcus ccmK, involved  in  the formation of the carboxysome which is
   a polyhedral inclusion where RuBisCO is sequestred.
 - Thiobacillus  neapolitanus  carboxysome  shell  proteins csoS1A, csoS1B and
   csoS1C.
 - A  number  of  hypothetical  Synechococcus proteins which are also probably
   involved in the carboxysome shell formation.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yffI.

These proteins  have  from 90 to 120 amino acid residues with the exception of
two Synechococcus  hypothetical  proteins  which contains respectively 275 and
297 amino  acids  and which are made up of two tandem homologous domains. As a
signature pattern, we selected a conserved region in their N-terminal section.

* Flagella basal body rod proteins signature *
**********************************************

Many bacterial species  swim  actively by means of flagella [1].  The flagella
organelle is made of three parts:  the basal body, the hook  and the filament.
The basal body consists of four rings (L,P,S, and M) mounted on a central rod.
In Salmonella typhimurium and related organisms the  rod has been shown [2] to
consist of  four different, yet evolutionary related proteins:  in  the distal
portion of the  rod  there  are  about  26 subunits of protein flgG and in the
proximal portion  there  are about 6 subunits each of proteins flgB, flgC, and
flgF.

These four proteins  contain  in  their N-terminal section  a highly conserved
asparagine-rich domain that we have used as a signature pattern.

This pattern is also found in:

 - Flagella hook protein flgE from Gram-negative bacteria.
 - Flagellar  hook-associated  protein  1  (HAP1)  (flgK)  from  Gram-negative
   bacteria.

* Plant viruses icosahedral capsid proteins 'S' region signature *
******************************************************************

The capsid protein of plant  icosahedral positive strand RNA viruses generally
consists of four distinct domains: an N-terminal positively charged 'R' domain
involved in the  interaction with RNA,  a connecting arm 'a', a central domain
'S' forming the virion shell, and a C-terminal projecting 'P' domain.  Some of
the viruses lack either the R or P domains.

It has been shown [1] that the S domain  of the  capsid protein of a number of
plant viruses are evolutionary related, namely:

 - Carmoviruses: carnation mottle  virus (CarMV),  melon  necrotic  spot virus
   (MNSV), and turnip crinkle virus (TCV).
 - Dianthoviruses: red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV).
 - Sobemoviruses: maize  chlorotic  mottle  virus  (MCMV),  and  southern bean
   mosaic virus (SBMV).
 - Tombusviruses: artichoke mottled  crinkle virus (AMCV),  cucumber  necrosis
   virus (CNV), cymbidium ringspot virus (CyRSV), and tomato bushy stunt virus
   (TBSV).
 - Tobacco necrosis virus (TNV).

The S domain of these viruses  contains  from 158  to  166 amino acids  and is
composed of eight beta-strand anti-parallel twisted sheets in what is known as
a 'jellyroll' conformation.  The  signature  pattern for this domain starts at
the C-terminal  part of the 3rd  beta-strand  and extends up to the end of the
4th strand.

*************************************************
* Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels signature *
*************************************************

Neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels [1,2,3,4] provide the molecular  basis for
rapid  signal  transmission  at  chemical  synapses.  They  are  post-synaptic
oligomeric transmembrane complexes that transiently form a ionic  channel upon
the binding  of  a  specific  neurotransmitter.  Presently,  the  sequence  of
subunits from five types of neurotransmitter-gated receptors are known:

 - The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR),  an excitatory cation channel.
   In  the motor  endplates  of vertebrates, it is  composed of four different
   subunits  (alpha,  beta,  gamma  and   delta  or  epsilon)   with  a  molar
   stoichiometry of 2:1:1:1. In neurones, the AchR receptor is composed of two
   different  types  of  subunits:  alpha  and  non-alpha  (also called beta).
   Nicotinic AchRs are also found in invertebrates.
 - The glycine  receptor, an inhibitory  chloride  ion  channel.  The  glycine
   receptor is a pentamer composed of two different subunits (alpha and beta).
 - The gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA)  receptor, which  is  also an inhibitory
   chloride ion channel.  The quaternary  structure  of the  GABA receptor  is
   complex; at least four classes of subunits are known to exist (alpha, beta,
   gamma, and delta)  and  there are many variants in each class (for example:
   six variants of the alpha class have already been sequenced).
 - The serotonin 5HT3 receptor. Serotonin is a biogenic hormone that functions
   as a  neurotransmitter, a hormone  and a mitogen.    There are seven  major
   groups of serotonin receptors; six of these groups (5HT1, 5HT2, and 5HT4 to
   5HT7) transduce extracellular signal  by  activating G proteins, while 5HT3
   is a ligand-gated cation-specific ion channel  which, when activated causes
   fast, depolarizing responses in neurons.
 - The glutamate receptor, an excitatory cation channel. Glutamate is the main
   excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.   At  least three different types
   of glutamate receptors have been described and are named according to their
   selective agonists (kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and quisqualate).

All  known sequences of subunits  from neurotransmitter-gated ion-channels are
structurally related.  They are composed of a large extracellular glycosylated
N-terminal ligand-binding domain,  followed by three hydrophobic transmembrane
regions which form the ionic channel, followed  by an intracellular  region of
variable length. A fourth hydrophobic region is found at the C-terminal of the
sequence.

The sequence of subunits  from  the  AchR, GABA,  5HT3, and  Gly receptors are
clearly evolutionary related and  share many regions of sequence similarities.
These sequence  similarities  are  either  absent  or  very  weak  in  the Glu
receptors.

In the N-terminal  extracellular domain of AchR/GABA/5HT3/Gly receptors, there
are two conserved cysteine residues, which, in AchR, have been shown to form a
disulfide bond  essential to the tertiary structure of the receptor.  A number
of amino acids between the two disulfide-bonded  cysteines are also conserved.
We have therefore used this region as a signature pattern for this subclass of
proteins.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL the ion-
 gated receptors except for glutamate receptors.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: in most AchR subunits and in GABA beta subunits, the residue N-terminal
 to the second cysteine is a N-glycosylated asparagine.

* ATP P2X receptors signature *
*******************************

P2X purinoreceptors  [1,2]  are  cation-selective  ion  channels  that open on
binding to  extracellular  ATP; they play a role in fast synaptic transmission
between neurones,  and  from  autonomic  nerves to smooth muscles. When ATP is
released as  a  neurotransmitter from central and peripheral nerves it acts at
P2X receptors to produce postsynaptic depolarization and excitation.

P2X receptors  are  from  397 to 595 amino acids long. They consist of a short
intracellular N-terminus  region  followed  by a transmembrane domain, a large
extracellular loop   that   contains   10   conserved   cysteines,   a  second
transmembrane segment and a C-terminal intracellular tail.

Currently, seven forms (P2X1 to P2X7) of P2X receptors are known.

As a  signature pattern, we selected a conserved region located in the central
part of  the  extracellular  domain  and  which  contains two of the conserved
cysteines.

   birds.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  putative    receptors  C06G4.5, C38C10.1, C43C3.2,
   T27D1.3 and ZC84.4.
 - Three putative receptors encoded  in  the  genome of cytomegalovirus: US27,
   US28, and UL33.
 - ECRF3, a putative receptor encoded in the genome of herpesvirus saimiri.

The  structure of all  these receptors is  thought  to be identical. They have
seven hydrophobic regions,  each  of which most probably  spans  the membrane.
The N-terminus is located on the  extracellular  side of the  membrane  and is
often  glycosylated,  while  the  C-terminus  is  cytoplasmic   and  generally
phosphorylated.  Three extracellular loops  alternate with three intracellular
loops to link the seven transmembrane regions.  Most,  but  not  all  of these
receptors, lack a signal peptide. The most conserved parts  of  these proteins
are the transmembrane regions and the first two cytoplasmic loops. A conserved
acidic-Arg-aromatic triplet is  present  in  the N-terminal  extremity  of the
second cytoplasmic loop [15] and could be implicated in the interaction with G
proteins.

To detect this widespread family of  proteins we have developed a pattern that
contains the conserved triplet and that also spans the major part of the third
transmembrane helix.  We  have  also  developed a profile that spans the seven
transmembrane regions.

* G-protein coupled receptors family 2 signatures and profiles *
****************************************************************

A number  of  peptide hormones bind to G-protein coupled receptors that, while
structurally similar  to  family  1  of G-protein coupled receptors (R7G) (see
<PDOC00210>), do  not show any similarity at the level of their sequence, thus
representing a new family whose current known members [1,2] are listed below:

 - Calcitonin receptor.
 - Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.
 - Corticotropin releasing factor receptor types 1 and 2.
 - Gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor.
 - Glucagon receptor.
 - Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor.
 - Growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor.
 - Parathyroid hormone / parathyroid hormone-related peptide types 1 and 2.
 - Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide receptor.
 - Secretin receptor.
 - Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor types 1 and 2.
 - Insects diuretic hormone receptor.

In addition to the above characterized receptors, this family also includes:

 - Caenorhabditis elegans putative receptor C13B9.4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans putative receptor ZK643.3.

 - Leucocyte antigen CD97, a protein that contains, in its N-terminal section,
   3 EGF-like domains (see <PDOC00021>).
 - Cell  surface glycoprotein EMR1, a protein that contains, in its N-terminal
   section, 6 to 7 EGF-like domains (see <PDOC00021>).

All the  characterized receptors are coupled to G-proteins which activate both
adenylyl cyclase and the phosphatidylinositol-calcium pathway.

Like family  1  R7G  they  seem  to contain seven transmembrane regions. Their
N-terminus is probably located on the extracellular side of the  membrane  and
potentially glycosylated, while their C-terminus is probably cytoplasmic.

Every receptor  gene  in this family is encoded on multiple exons, and several
of these  genes  are  alternatively  spliced  to  yield  functionally distinct
products.

Family two  G  protein  coupled  receptors  contain a long conserved region in
their N  terminal extracellular part which allow the binding of large peptidic
ligand such  as  glucagon,  secretin,  VIP and PACAP [3]. This region contains
five conserved  cysteines residues which could be involved in disulfide bonds;
we have  developed  a  pattern  in  the  region  that  spans  the  first three
cysteines. We  also  developed  a  profile that covers the whole extracellular
domain. 

One of the most highly conserved regions spans the C-terminal part of the last
transmembrane  region and the  beginning of the adjacent intracellular region.
We  have  used  this region as a second signature pattern. We also developed a 
profile that spans the seven transmembrane regions.

* G-protein coupled receptors family 3 signatures and profile *
***************************************************************

Glutamate and  calcium  bind  to  G-protein  coupled    receptors  that, while
structurally similar to the majority of G-protein coupled receptors (R7G) (see
the relevant entry <PDOC00210>),  do not show any  similarity  at the level of
their sequence, thus representing a new family whose current known members are
listed below:

 - The  metabotropic  glutamate  receptors  which evoke a variety of function,
   such as  long-tern  potentiation,  memory  acquisition  and learning, etc.,
   through the modulation of intracellular effectors [1,2,3].  Currently there
   are eight known  subtypes  of  metabotropic glutamate  receptors; mGluR1 to
   mGluR8. The  subtypes  mGluR1  and mGluR5 are coupled to the stimulation of
   the phosphatidylinositol-calcium  second  messenger  system  while  mGluR2,
   mGluR3, mGluR4,  mGluR6,  mGluR7  and mGluR8 are coupled to G proteins that
   inhibit adenylate cyclase activity.
 - The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor [4]  which  sense changes in the
   extracellular concentration of calcium ions.  The activity of this receptor
   is coupled  to  the  stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol-calcium second
   messenger system.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZC506.4.

Structurally these receptors are composed of:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) A  very  large  hydrophilic extracellular region of about 540 to 600 amino
    acid  residues. This region contains 17 conserved cysteines which could be
    involved in disulfide bonds;
 c) A region of about 250 residues that  seem  to  contain seven transmembrane
    domains;
 d) A C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of variable length (50 to 350 residues).

There are quite a number of regions of high sequence conservation both  in the
N-terminal domain  and  in the region containing the transmembrane domains. We
have selected  three  of  these  conserved  regions as signature patterns. The
first one corresponds to a highly conserved hydrophobic segment in the central
part of  the  N-terminal  extracellular  region.  The  second corresponds to a
section that contains a cluster of six cysteines in the C-terminal part of the
extracellular domain.  The  last one corresponds to the C-terminal part of the
cytoplasmic loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains.

We also developed a profile which covers the seven transmembrane regions.

*************************************************
* Visual pigments (opsins) retinal binding site *
*************************************************

Visual pigments [1,2] are the light-absorbing  molecules that  mediate vision.
They consist of  an apoprotein, opsin,  covalently  linked  to the chromophore
cis-retinal.  Vision is  effected through  the absorption of a  photon by cis-
retinal  which is isomerized to  trans-retinal.  This isomerization leads to a
change  of conformation  of the protein. Opsins are integral membrane proteins
with  seven transmembrane regions that belong to family 1 of G-protein coupled
receptors (see <PDOC00210>).

In vertebrates four different pigments are generally found.   Rod cells, which
mediate vision in dim light, contain the pigment rhodopsin.  Cone cells, which
function in bright light, are responsible  for  color vision and contain three
or more color pigments (for example, in mammals: red, blue and green).

In Drosophila, the  eye   is composed   of 800   facets  or   ommatidia.  Each
ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R8):  the R1 to R6 cells are
outer cells,  R7  and R8 inner cells. Each of the three types of cells (R1-R6,
R7 and R8) expresses a specific opsin.

Proteins evolutionary related to opsins include squid retinochrome, also known
as retinal  photoisomerase, which converts various isomers of retinal into 11-
cis retinal and mammalian retinal pigment  epithelium (RPE) RGR [3], a protein
that may also act in retinal isomerization.

The attachment  site  for  retinal in the above proteins is a conserved lysine
residue in  the  middle  of  the  seventh  transmembrane helix. The pattern we
developed includes this residue.

* Bacterial rhodopsins signatures *
***********************************

Bacterial rhodopsins [1,2,3] are a family of retinal-containing proteins found
in extremely  halophilic  bacteria which provide light-dependent ion transport
and sensory functions for these organisms.   Bacterial rhodopsins are integral
membrane proteins  with seven transmembrane regions.  The retinal choromophore
is covalently  linked,  via  a  Schiff's base, to the epsilon-amino group of a
conserved lysine residue in the middle of the last transmembrane helix (called
helix  G). There are at least three types of bacterial rhodopsins:

 - Bacteriorhodopsin  (bop)  [E1],  and archaerhodopsins 1 and 2, light-driven
   proton pumps.
 - Halorhodopsin (hop), a light-driven chloride pump.
 - Sensory rhodopsin (sop), which mediates  both  photoattractant (in the red)
   and photophobic (in the near UV) responses.

We developed  two  patterns  which  allow  the specific detection of bacterial
rhodopsins. The first  pattern  corresponds  to the third transmembrane region
(called helix  C) and includes an arginine residue which seems involved in the
release of  a  proteon from the Schiff's base to the extracellular medium. The
second pattern includes the retinal binding lysine

* Receptor tyrosine kinase class II signature *
***********************************************

A number of growth factors  stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a family
of   cell  surface receptors which   possess  an  intrinsic, ligand-sensitive,
protein tyrosine kinase activity [1].   These  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
all share the same topology: an  extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single
transmembrane  region and a cytoplasmic  kinase domain.   However  they can be
classified into at least five groups.  The prototype for class II RTK's is the
insulin receptor,  a heterotetramer of two alpha and two beta chains linked by
disulfide bonds.  The  alpha  and  beta  chains  are  cleavage  products  of a
precursor molecule. The alpha chain contains the ligand binding site, the beta
chain transverses  the  membrane  and  contains  the  tyrosine  protein kinase
domain. The receptors currently known to belong to class II are:

 - Insulin receptor from vertebrates.
 - Insulin growth factor I receptor from mammals.
 - Insulin  receptor-related receptor (IRR), which is most probably a receptor
   for a peptide belonging to the insulin family.
 - Insects insulin-like receptors.
 - Molluscan insulin-related peptide(s) receptor (MIP-R).
 - Insulin-like peptide receptor from Branchiostoma lanceolatum.
 - The  Drosophila  developmental  protein  sevenless, a putative receptor for
   positional information required for the formation of  the  R7 photoreceptor
   cells.
 - The  trk  family  of receptors  (NTRK1,  NTRK2  and  NTRK3), which are high
   affinity receptors for nerve growth factor and related neurotrophic factors
   (BDNF and NT-3).

And the following uncharacterized receptors:

 - ROS.
 - LTK (TYK1).
 - EDDR1 (cak, TRKE, RTK6).
 - NTRK3 (Tyro10, TKT).
 - A sponge putative receptor tyrosine kinase.

While only the insulin and the insulin growth factor I  receptors are known to
exist in the tetrameric conformation specific to class II RTK's, all the above
proteins share extensive homologies in their kinase domain,  especially around
the putative  site  of  autophosphorylation.  Hence,  we developed a signature
pattern for  this  class of RTK's, which includes the tyrosine residue, itself
probably autophosphorylated.

extracellular section. Their kinase domain differs from that of other RTK's by
the insertion of a stretch of 70 to 100 hydrophilic residues in  the middle of
this domain. The receptors currently known to belong to class III are:

 - Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R).  PDGF-R exists as a homo-
   or heterodimer of two related chains: alpha and beta [3].
 - Macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1-R)  (also known as the

A number of growth factors  stimulate mitogenesis by interacting with a family

all share the same topology: an  extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single
transmembrane  region and a cytoplasmic  kinase domain.   However  they can be
classified into at  least  five groups on the basis of  sequence similarities.
The extracellular domain of class V RTK's consist  of  a  region  of about 300
amino acids,  amongst  which  16  conserved    cysteines  probably involved in
disulfide bonds;  this  region is followed by two copies of a fibronectin type
III domain.  The ligands  for these receptors are proteins of about 200 to 300
residues collectively  known  as  Ephrins  (see  <PDOC01003>).  The  receptors
currently known to belong to class V are [2,3,E1]:

 - EPHA1 (Eph-1; Esk).
 - EPHA2 (Eck; Mpk-5; Sek-2).
 - EPHA3 (Etk-1; Hek; Mek4; Tyro4; Rek4; Cek4).
 - EPHA4 (Sek; Hek8; Mpk-3; Cek8).

 - EPHB3 (Hek-2; Mdk-5).
 - EPHB4 (Htk; Mdk-2; Myk-1).
 - EPHB5 (Cek9).

The EPHA subtype receptors bind to GPI-anchored ephrins while the EPHB subtype
receptors bind to type-I membrane ephrins.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for  this  class  of RTK's, which each

* Long hematopoietin receptor, single chain family signature *
**************************************************************

A number  of  receptors  for  lymphokines,  hematopoietic  growth  factors and
growth hormone-related  molecules  have  been  found to share a common binding
domain. These  receptors  are  designated as hematopoietin receptors [1,2] and
the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been
subdivided into  two  major  structural  groups:  Large/long  and  small/short
hematopoietins.

Several receptor  chains  for  large  hematopoietins  are structurally related
such that  their  extracellular  parts  strictly  contain  the 200 amino-acids
hematopoietin domain,   duplicated  in  the  thrombopoietin  receptor  and  in
avian prolactin receptors. This subgroup of receptor chains contains:

 - Growth hormone receptor (GHR).
 - Prolactin receptor (PRLR).
 - Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR).
 - Thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR).

* Long hematopoietin receptor, gp130 family signature *
*******************************************************

A number  of  receptors  for  lymphokines,  hematopoietic  growth  factors and
growth hormone-related  molecules  have  been  found to share a common binding
domain. These  receptors  are  designated as hematopoietin receptors [1,2] and
the corresponding ligands as hematopoietins. Further, hematopoietins have been
subdivided into  two  major  structural  groups:  Large/long  and  small/short
hematopoietins.

One subset  of  individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes
for large   hematopoietins   contain   common  structural  elements  in  their
extracellular parts:  an  immunoglobin-like  domain, an hematopoietin-receptor
domain, and  3  fibronectin  type-III domains (2 in the leptin receptor). This
subgroup was  designated  as  "gp130 family of receptors" [3] and contains the
following chains:

 - Leptin receptor (LPTR).
 - Granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor  (GCSFR).
 - Interleukin-6/-11/LIF/OSM/CNTF common beta chain (GP130).
 - Leukemia inhibiting factor receptor (LIFR).
 - Oncostatin-M receptor beta chain (OSMR).
 - Interleukin-12 receptor beta-1 chain (IL12RB1).
 - Interleukin-12 receptor beta-2 chain (IL12RB2).

A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:

          +-+  +--+

These receptor  chains  homodimerize  (GCSFR,  GP130,  LPTR) or heterodimerize
(GP130 with  LIFR  or  OSMR, IL12RB1 with IL12RB2) upon binding of the cognate
cytokine: G-CSF,   LIF,   OSM,  LPT,  or  the  cytokine/alpha  chain  complex:
IL-6/IL6RA, IL-11/IL11RA, CNTF/CNTFRA, IL-12 (p35/p40) [4,5].

We have  used  one  pattern  to  detect  this  family. The motif covers the c-
terminal end  of  the  first  fibronectin  III  domain and the n-terminal part
of the second fibronectin III domain.

A number  of  receptors  for  lymphokines,  hematopoietic  growth  factors and

extracellular  parts:  an immunoglobulin-like  domain at the N-terminal end of
the hematopoietin  receptor domain (except for the EBCV-induced interleukin-12
beta chain)  and a short (or no) cytoplasmic domain. They define a structural 
subgroup containing the following chains:

 - Interleukin-6 receptor alpha chain (IL6RA).
 - Interleukin-11 receptor alpha chain (IL11RA).
 - Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha chain (CNTFRA).
 - Interleukin-12 beta chain p40 (IL12BC).
 - Interleukin-12 beta chain induced by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBI3).

A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:

Members of  this  subgroup  bind  to their cognate cytokines with low affinity
and possess  transmembrane  and  short cytoplasmic domains (IL6RA and IL11RA),
or are  GPi-linked  membrane  proteins  (CNTFRA).  Truncated  soluble forms of
IL-6 and  CNTF  receptors  alpha  chains are physiologically active [3]. IL-12
is an  heterodimeric  cytokine  made  of an alpha chain (p35) and a beta chain
(p40). p40  (IL12BC)  can  be  regarded  as  an alpha chain receptor devoid of
cytoplasmic domain  [4].  Members  of  this  family  have  the ability to bind
corresponding cytokines with no signalling function.

We have  used  one  pattern to detect this family. The motif is located in the
middle of the 200 amino acids hematopoietin domain.

hematopoietins.

One subset  of  individual receptor chains that are part of receptor complexes
for small   hematopoietins   are   structurally   related   such   that  their
extracellular parts   strictly   contain  the  200  amino-acids  hematopoietin
domain (duplicated  in  IL-3/-5/GM-CSF  beta  chain  receptors  KH97/AIC2B and
AIC2A). They define a structural subgroup containing the following chains:

 - Interleukin-2 receptor beta chain (IL2RB)
 - Interleukin-2 receptor common gamma chain (IL2RG)
 - Interleukin-3 receptor beta chain (AIC2A)
 - Interleukin-3/-5/GM-CSF receptor common beta chain (KH97/AIC2B)
 - Interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain (IL4RA)
 - Interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL7RA)
 - Interleukin-9 receptor alpha chain (IL9RA)

A schematic representation of the structure of these receptors is shown below:

IL4RA, IL7RA  and  IL9RA  are  specific  alpha  chain receptors for IL-4, IL-7
and IL-9  respectively,  whereas  IL2RB is common to IL-2 and IL-15 (IL2RA and
IL15RA are  not  members  of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily). IL2RG is
part of  IL-2,  IL-15,  IL-7,  IL-9  and  IL-4  form I receptor complexes [3].
KH97/AIC2B chain  is  part  of GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-5 receptor complexes and in
the mouse,  AIC2B  can  be  substituted  by AIC2A, an IL-3 specific beta chain
receptor [4].  Together  with  either  IL13RA1  or IL13RA2, IL4RA is also part
of the  IL-13  receptor  complex  for  which IL-4 can compete with IL-13 (IL-4
receptor complex form II) [5].

We have  used  one  pattern  to detect this subfamily. The motif is located at
the carboxy-terminal part of the 200 amino acid hematopoietin domain.

* TNFR/NGFR family cysteine-rich region signature and profile *
***************************************************************

A number  of  proteins,  some  of  which  are known to be receptors for growth
factors, have  been  found  to contain a cysteine-rich  domain of about 110 to
160 amino acids in their N-terminal part, that can be subdivided into four (or
in some  cases,  three)  modules  of  about 40 residues containing 6 conserved
cysteines. Proteins known to belong to this family [1,2,3,4] are listed below:

 - Tumor Necrosis Factor type I and type II receptors (TNFR).  Both  receptors
   bind TNF-alpha  and  TNF-beta, but  are  only  similar in the cysteine-rich
   region.
 - Shope fibroma virus soluble TNF receptor (protein T2).
 - Lymphotoxin alpha/beta receptor.
 - Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LA-NGFR) (p75).
 - CD40 (Bp50), the receptor for the CD40L (or TRAP) cytokine.
 - CD27, the receptor for the CD27L cytokine.
 - CD30, the receptor for the CD30L cytokine.
 - T-cell protein 4-1BB, the receptor for the 4-1BBL putative cytokine.
 - FAS  antigen  (or  APO-1),  the  receptor  for  FASL, a protein involved in
   apoptosis (programmed cell death).
 - T-cell antigen OX40, the receptor for the OX40L cytokine.
 - Wsl-1, a receptor (for a yet undefined ligand) that mediates apoptosis.
 - Vaccinia virus protein A53 (SalF19R).

It has  been  shown  [5]  that the six  cysteines  all  involved in intrachain
disulfide bonds. A schematic representation of the structure of the 40 residue
module of these receptors is shown below:

                  +-------------+    +--------------+

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

We have  developed  a  signature  pattern  for the cysteine-rich region. It is
based mainly  on  the  position  of the six conserved cysteines in each of the
repeats. The profile spans the complete domain.

* Integrins alpha chain signature *
***********************************

Integrins [1,2] are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell
to cell as well as cell to matrix adhesion. Some integrins recognize the R-G-D
sequence in their extracellular matrix protein ligand. Structurally, integrins
consist of a dimer of an alpha and a beta chain.  Each  subunit  has  a  large
N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short
C-terminal cytoplasmic  region.    Some    alpha  subunits   are cleaved post-
translationally to produce  a  heavy  and a  light chain linked by a disulfide
bond. The  sequence  of  a  number  of  alpha chains has been obtained and are
listed below:

 - The alpha-1 chain (VLA-1) (CD49a)  which,  with the beta-1 chain, acts as a
   receptor for laminin and collagen.
 - The alpha-2 chain (VLA-2) (CD49b)  which,  with the beta-1 chain, acts as a
   receptor that binds collagen.
 - The alpha-3 chain (VLA-3) (Galactoprotein B3).
 - The alpha-4 chain (VLA-4) (CD49d)  which,  with the beta-1 chain, interacts
   with vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1).
 - The alpha-5 chain (VLA-5) (CD49e) which,  with  the beta-1 chain,  forms  a
   receptor specific to fibronectin.
 - The alpha-6 chain (VLA-6) which,  with  the beta-1  chain, forms a platelet
   laminin receptor.
 - The  alpha-7  chain which, with the beta-1 chain, forms a skeletal myoblast
   laminin receptor.
 - The alpha-8 chain which, with the  beta-1 chain  plays  a  possible role in
   cell-cell interactions during axon-growth and fasciculation.
 - The alpha-L chain (LFA-1) (CD11a)  which, with the beta-2 chain,  interacts
   with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1).
 - The alpha-M chain (MAC-1) (CD11b)  which, with  the beta-2 chain, forms the
   receptor for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
 - The alpha-X chain (p150,95) (CD11c) which, with  the beta-2 chain, probably
   forms a receptor for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
 - The alpha-V chain (CD51) which,  with  the  beta-3 chain,  forms a receptor
   that binds vitronectin.
 - The alpha-IIB chain (CD41) (also known as platelet glycoprotein IIb) which,
   with  the beta-3 chain, forms  a  receptor  which  binds  VWF,  fibrinogen,
   fibronectin, and vitronectin.
 - The Drosophila position-specific antigen 2 alpha chain (PS2).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F54F2.1 and F54G8.3.

All these  integrin  alpha chains share a conserved sequence which is found at
the beginning   of   the  cytoplasmic  domain,  just  after  the  end  of  the
transmembrane region.   This   motif   is  probably  involved  in  heterodimer
association and  may  lock the heterodimer into a low affinity conformation in
the abscence  of  activating  signals. We have used this conserved region as a
signature pattern.

*******************************************************

Integrins [1,2] are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell
to cell as well as cell to matrix adhesion. Some integrins recognize the R-G-D
sequence in their extracellular matrix protein ligand. Structurally, integrins
consist of a dimer of an alpha and a beta chain.  Each  subunit  has  a  large
N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short
C-terminal cytoplasmic  region. Some receptors share a common beta chain while
having different  alpha chains.  The  sequence  of  a number of different beta
chains has been determined and are listed below:

 - Integrin beta-1, which  associates with alpha-1 to form a laminin receptor,
   with alpha-2 to form a  collagen receptor, with  alpha-4  to  interact with
   VCAM-1, with alpha-5 to form a fibronectin receptor, and with alpha-8.
 - Integrin beta-2, which  associates with alpha-L (LFA-1)  to  interact  with
   ICAM-1, and with alpha-M (MAC-1) or alpha-X  (p150,95) to form the receptor
   for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
 - Integrin beta-3, which associates with alpha-IIB  to  form  a  receptor for
   fibrinogen,  fibronectin,  vitronectin and VWF, and with alpha-V  to form a
   vitronectin receptor.

* Natriuretic peptides receptors signature *
********************************************

Natriuretic peptides  are  hormones  involved  in  the regulation of fluid and
electrolyte homeostasis. These hormones stimulate the intracellular production
of cyclic GMP as a second messenger.

Currently, three types of natriuretic peptide receptors are known [1,2].   Two
express guanylate  cyclase activity: GC-A (or ANP-A)  which  seems specific to
atrial  natriuretic  peptide  (ANP), and  GC-B (or ANP-B) which  seems  to  be
stimulated  more  effectively  by brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) than by ANP.
The third receptor (ANP-C) is  probably  responsible  for the clearance of ANP
from the circulation and does not play a role in signal transduction.

GC-A and GC-B are  plasma  membrane-bound  proteins  that  share the following
topology: an N-terminal extracellular domain  which acts as the ligand binding
region, then  a  transmembrane  domain  followed  by  a  large  cytoplasmic C-
terminal region that can be subdivided into two domains: a protein kinase-like
domain (see <PDOC00100>) that  appears important  for  proper signalling and a
guanylate cyclase catalytic domain (see <PDOC00425>). The topology of ANP-C is
different: like  GC-A  and  -B  it  possesses  an extracellular ligand-binding
region and a transmembrane domain, but its cytoplasmic domain is very short.

We developed  a pattern from the ligand-binding  region of natriuretic peptide
receptors based on a highly conserved region located in the N-terminal part of
the domain.

In the  photosynthetic   reaction  center  of purple bacteria, two  homologous
integral membrane proteins, L(ight) and M(edium), are known to be essential to
the  light-mediated  water-splitting process.     In  the  photosystem  II  of
eukaryotic chloroplasts two  related  proteins are involved: the D1 (psbA) and
D2 proteins (psbD).     These four types of protein  probably evolved  from  a
common ancestor [see 1,2 for recent reviews].

We  developed a  signature  pattern  which  include  two  conserved  histidine
residues. In  L and M chains, the first histidine is a ligand of the magnesium
ion of  the  special  pair  bacteriochlorophyll,  the  second is a ligand of a
ferrous non-heme iron atom. In photosystem II these two histidines are thought
to play a similar role.

* Antenna complexes alpha and beta subunits signatures *
********************************************************

In photosynthetic bacteria the antenna  complexes function as light-harvesting
systems that absorb light radiation and transfer the  excitation energy to the
reaction centers.    The  antenna    complexes  are  generally composed of two
polypeptides (alpha and beta chains); two  or three bacteriochlorophyll (BChl)
molecules and some carotenoids [1,2].

Both the  alpha and the beta chains of antenna complexes are small proteins of
42 to  68  residues which share a three-domain organization. They are composed
of a  N-terminal  hydrophilic  cytoplasmic  domain followed by a transmembrane
region and  a  C-terminal hydrophilic periplasmic domain. In the transmembrane
region of  both  chains  there is a conserved histidine which is most probably
involved in  the binding of the magnesium atom of a bacteriochlorophyll group.
The beta  chains contain an additional conserved histidine which is located at
the C-terminal extremity  of the  cytoplasmic domain and which is also thought
to be involved in bacteriochlorophyll-binding.

We have developed  signature patterns for the alpha and for the beta subunits.
These signature patterns include the conserved histidine residues.

Photosystem I  (PSI)  [1]  is  an integral membrane protein complex  that uses
light energy to mediate electron transfer from plastocyanin to ferredoxin. PSI
is found  in  the  chloroplast   of  plants  and  cyanobacteria.  The electron
transfer components  of  the  reaction  center of PSI  are a primary  electron
donor P-700 (chlorophyll dimer) and five electron acceptors: A0 (chlorophyll),
A1 (a phylloquinone) and three 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur centers: Fx, Fa, and Fb.

PsaA and psaB, two closely related proteins, are  involved  in  the binding of
P700, A0, A1, and Fx.  psaA  and  psaB  are both integral membrane proteins of
730 to 750 amino acids that seem to contain 11 transmembrane segments.  The Fx
4Fe-4S iron-sulfur center is bound by four cysteines;   two of these cysteines
are provided by the psaA protein and the two others by psaB. The two cysteines
in both  proteins  are  proximal  and located in a loop  between the ninth and
tenth transmembrane segments.  A leucine zipper motif  seems to be present [2]
downstream of the cysteines and could contribute to dimerization of psaA/psaB.

The signature pattern  for  these proteins is based on the perfectly conserved
region that includes the two iron-sulfur binding cysteines.

large extracellular domain of 450 residues, followed by a transmembrane region
and  a small  cytoplasmic  domain of 12 amino acids.  The extracellular domain
contains four repeats of a 115 amino acids domain. There are 17 positions that
are perfectly conserved in the four repeats, among them are six cysteines, six
glycines, and three glutamates.

Such a domain is also  found, once, in  the  C-terminal  section  of mammalian
macrophage scavenger receptor type I [2], a  membrane glycoproteins implicated
in  the pathologic  deposition  of  cholesterol  in  arterial   walls   during

In Escherichia coli the tonB protein interacts  with  outer  membrane receptor
proteins that  carry  out high-affinity binding and energy-dependent uptake of
specific substrates  into  the  periplasmic space. These substrates are either
poorly permeable  through  the  porin  channels or are encountered at very low
concentrations. In the absence  of tonB these  receptors bind their substrates
but do not carry out active transport.  The tonB  protein  also interacts with
some colicins.  The  proteins that are currently known or presumed to interact
with tonB are:

Most of  these proteins contain, at their N-terminus, a short conserved region

the tonB protein [4]. With  the  exception of the colicin B, D and M receptors
they all  also contain, in their C-terminal extremity a short conserved domain
that contains two invariant residues.

* Transmembrane 4 family signature *

Recently a number of eukaryotic  cell  surface  antigens have been found to be
evolutionary related [1,2,3]. The proteins known  to belong to this family are
listed below:

 - Mammalian antigen CD9 (MIC3); a protein involved in platelet activation and
   aggregation.
 - Mammalian leukocyte antigen CD37, expressed on B lymphocytes.
 - Mammalian leukocyte antigen CD53 (OX-44),  which may be involved in  growth
   regulation in hematopoietic cells.
 - Mammalian lysosomal  membrane  protein  CD63  (Melanoma-associated  antigen
   ME491; antigen AD1).
 - Mammalian antigen CD81  (Cell surface protein TAPA-1),  which  may  play an
   important role in the regulation of lymphoma cell growth.
 - Mammalian  antigen  CD82  (Protein R2; Antigen C33; Kangai 1 (KAI1)), which
   associates with  CD4  or  CD8  and  delivers  costimulatory signals for the
   TCR/CD3 pathway.
 - Mammalian  antigen  CD151 (SFA-1;  Platelet-endothelial tetraspan antigen 3
   (PETA-3)).
 - Mammalian TM4SF2 (Cell surface glycoprotein A15; TALLA-1; MXS1).
 - Mammalian TM4SF3 (Tumor-associated antigen CO-029).
 - Mammalian TM4SF6 (Tspan-6; TM4-D).
 - Mammalian TM4SF7 (Novel antigen 2 (NAG-2); Tspan-4).
 - Mammalian Tspan-2.
 - Mammalian Tspan-3 (TM4-A).
 - Mammalian Tetraspan NET-5.
 - Schistosoma mansoni and japonicum 23 Kd surface antigen (SM23 / SJ23).

These proteins  share  the following characteristics: they all seem to be type
III membrane  proteins  (type III proteins are integral membrane proteins that
contain a  N-terminal  membrane-anchoring  domain  which is not cleaved during
biosynthesis and  which  functions  both  as  a  translocation signal and as a
membrane anchor); they  also  contain  three additional transmembrane regions,
at least  seven  conserved  cysteines residues, and are  of  approximately the
same size  (218 to 284 residues). These proteins are collectively  know as the
'transmembrane 4  superfamily'  (TM4)  because they span the  plasma  membrane
four times.  A  schematic diagram of the domain structure of these proteins is
shown below.

 +-+-----+-------+----+-----+-----+-----------------------------+-----+----+

TMa       : transmembrane anchor.
TM2 to TM4: transmembrane regions 2 to 4.
'C'       : conserved cysteine.

As a  signature  for  these  proteins,  we  selected  a  conserved region that
includes two  cysteines  and  seems  to be located in a short cytoplasmic loop
between two transmembrane domains.

* Bacterial chemotaxis sensory transducers signature *
******************************************************

Bacterial chemotactic-signal transducers [1,2] are  proteins  that  respond to
changes in the concentration of attractants and repellents in the environment,
and transduce a signal from the  outside to  the  inside  of  the cell.  These
proteins  undergo  two  covalent  modifications:  deamidation  and  reversible
methylation.  Attractants  increase  the level of methylation while repellents
decrease it.    The methyl groups are added by the methyl-transferase cheR and
are removed by the methylesterase cheB.

In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, there are four different chemotactic
transducers:

 - tsr, responsible  for  taxis  to the attractants L-serine and related amino
   acids and away from the repellents leucine, indole, and weak acids.
 - tar, responsible for taxis to the attractants L-aspartate and related amino
   and dicarboxylic  acids.  Also mediates taxis to the attractant maltose via
   an interaction with the periplasmic maltose-binding protein. Mediates taxis
   away from the repellents cobalt and nickel.
 - trg, responsible for taxis to ribose  and galactose via an interaction with
   the periplasmic ribose- or galactose-binding proteins.
 - tap, responsible for taxis towards dipeptides via  an  interaction with the
   periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein.

In Enterobacter aerogenes [3] there are  at  least  two  different chemotactic
transducers:

 - tsr, responsible for taxis to the attractant L-serine.
 - tas, responsible for taxis to the attractant L-aspartate.

In Salmonella typhimurium [4], in addition to tar, there is:

 - tcp, responsible for taxis to the attractant citrate.

All these proteins are composed of the  same  structural domains: a N-terminal
region that  resembles a  signal  peptide,  but which is not removed from the
mature protein  and  serves  as  a  membrane-spanning  region;  a  periplasmic
domain of about  160 amino acids  that  forms  the  receptor  domain; a second
transmembrane region  and finally a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of about 300
amino acids which contains the methylation sites.

The methyl-accepting sites are  specific  glutamate  residues  (some  of these
sites are translated as  glutamine  but are  irreversibly deamidated by cheB).
They are  clustered  in  two  regions  of  the  cytoplasmic  domain  [5]. As a
signature pattern we have selected the first of these two regions.

* ER lumen protein retaining receptor signatures *
**************************************************

Proteins that reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) contain a
C-terminal tetrapeptide (generally K-D-E-L or H-D-E-L) that serves as a signal
for their retrieval (retrograde transport) from subsequent compartments of the
secretory pathway.  The  signal  is  recognized by a receptor molecule that is
believed to cycle between the cis side  of the Golgi apparatus and the ER [1].
This protein  is known  as the  ER lumen protein retaining receptor or also as
the 'KDEL  receptor'.  It  has  been  characterized  in  a variety of species,
including  fungi (gene  ERD2), plants, Plasmodium,  Drosophila and mammals. In
mammals two highly related forms of the receptor are known.

Structurally, the   receptor is a protein of about 220 residues that seems  to
contain seven transmembrane regions [2].  The  N-terminal part (3 residues) is
oriented toward the  lumen  while  the C-terminal  tail (about 12 residues) is
cytoplasmic. There are three lumenal and three cytoplasmic loops.

We developed  two  signature  patterns  for these receptors. The first pattern
corresponds to  the  C-terminal  half of the first cytoplasmic loop as well as
most of  the  second  transmembrane  domain. The second pattern is a perfectly
conserved decapeptide  that  corresponds  to  the  central  part  of the fifth
transmembrane domain.

Ephrins are  membrane-attached  proteins  of  205  to 340 residues. Attachment
appears to be crucial for their normal function. Type-A ephrins  are linked to
the membrane  via  a  GPI  linkage,  while  type-B ephrins are type-I membrane

* PTN/MK heparin-binding protein family signatures *

The following extracellular heparin-binding proteins involved in regulation of
growth and differentiation belong to a new family of growth factors [E1]:

 - Pleiotrophin (PTN) [1]. Also  known as  heparin-binding   growth-associated
   molecule (HB-GAM),   heparin-binding  growth  factor  8  (HBGF-8), heparin-
   binding neutrophic  factor) (HBNF) and osteoblast specific protein (OSF-1).
   This factor has neurite extension activity.
 - Midkine (MK) [2], a retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor.
 - Retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding protein (RI-HB) [3] from chicken. RI-
   has mitogenic activity and neurite extension activity for PC12 cells. RI-HB
   is possibly the chicken homolog of mammalian MK.
 - Pleiotrophic  factors  alpha-1 and -2 and beta-1 and -2 from Xenopus laevis
   [4], the homologs of respectively midkine and pleiotrophin.

These growth factors are highly related proteins of about 140 amino acids that
contain 10  conserved  cysteines  probably  involved in disulfide bonds (their
position is schematically represented in the figure below). These proteins are
also rich in basic residues and in tryptophan.

Nerve growth factor (NGF or beta-NGF) is a vertebrate protein that  stimulates
division and differentiation  of sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons [1,
2]. NGF is  a protein  of  about  120  residues that is  cleaved from a larger
precursor molecule.  It  contains  six  cysteines  all  involved in intrachain
disulfide bonds.  A  schematic representation of the structure of NGF is shown

Some proteins have been found [3] to be structurally and  functionally related
to NGF, these are:

 - Brain-derived neurotrophic  factor  (BDNF), a  protein   that  promotes the
   survival of neuronal populations all located either in the central  nervous
   system or directly connected to it.
 - Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), a  protein that  seems  to  promote  the survival of
   visceral and proprioceptive sensory neurons.
 - Neurotrophins-4/5 (NT-4/5), which  elicit  neurite outgrowth from explanted
   dorsal root  ganglia  and  could  play a role  in  oogenesis  and/or  early
   embryogenesis.
 - Neurotrophin-6.
 - Neurotrophin-7 from zebrafish.

these  proteins  and  include  two of the six cysteines  involved in disulfide
bonds.

* Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family signature and profile *
**********************************************************************

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) [1,2] is a potent mitogen  for  cells of
mesenchymal  origin,  including  smooth  muscle  cells and glial  cells.  PDGF
consists of  two  different  but closely related chains (A and B chains) which
assemble  to form  disulfide  linked homo- or heterodimers (A-A, B-B, an A-B).
Alternate splicing of the A chain  transcript  can give rise to  two different
forms that differ only in their C-terminal extremity. The transforming protein
of simian sarcoma virus (SSV), encoded by the v-sis oncogene,  is derived from
the B chain of PDGF.

PDGF is  structurally  related  to a number of other growth factors which also
form disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers:

 - Vascular   endothelial   growth  factor  (VEGF),  also  known  as  vascular
   permeability factor  (VPF)  [3], a growth factor active in angiogenesis and
   endothelial cell growth. The genome of the orf poxvirus encodes an  homolog
   of VEGF [4].
 - Vascular  endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B), also active in angiogenesis
   and endothelial cell growth [5].
 - Vascular  endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-C), also active in angiogenesis
   and endothelial cell growth [6].
 - Placenta growth factor (PlGF) [7], which is also active in agiogenesis.

As a signature pattern for this family of growth factors, we selected a region
that include four of  the eight  cysteines conserved in the sequences of these
proteins. In  PDGF,  these  cysteines  are  known to be involved in intra- and
inter-chain disulfide  bonds  [8].  We also developed a profile that spans the
eight conserved cysteines.

Many low-molecular  weight  factors  secreted  by cells including fibroblasts,
macrophages and  endothelial cells,  in  response  to  a  variety  of  stimuli
such as  growth factors,  interferons,  viral  transformation   and  bacterial
products, are structurally related [1,2,3,E1]. Most members of this  family of
proteins seem to have mitogenic, chemotactic or inflammatory activities. These
small cytokines are also  called intercrines or chemokines.  They are cationic
proteins of 70 to 100  amino  acid residues that share four conserved cysteine
residues involved in  two disulfide bonds, as shown in the following schematic
representation:

                             +------------------------------------+

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.

These proteins can be  sorted into two  groups based on the spacing of the two
amino-terminal cysteines.  In the first group, the two cysteines are separated
by a  single  residue  (C-x-C),  while  in the second group, they are adjacent
(C-C).

The 'C-x-C' group is currently known to consist of the following proteins:

 - Platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein released from platelet alpha-granules as
   a complex with a proteoglycan molecule.   PF4 neutralizes the anticoagulant
   effect of heparin because  it  binds  more strongly  to heparin than to the
   chondroitin-4-sulfate chains  of  the  carrier molecule. PF4 is chemotactic
   for neutrophils and monocytes.
 - Platelet basic protein (PBP), which is the precursor of two active peptides:
   connective-tissue  activating  peptide III (CTAP III)   (also known as low-
   affinity platelet factor IV (LA-PF4)) and beta-thromboglobulin. CTAP-III is
   a growth  factor  that  stimulates a  variety  of  specific  metabolic  and
   cellular activities.
 - Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a monokine  which is  released  from monocytes  by an
   inflammatory response and which is selectively chemotactic for neutrophils.
   IL-8 is  also  known  as  Monocyte-Derived  Neutrophil  Chemotactic  Factor
   (MDNCF), or as Neutrophil Activating Protein 1 (NAP-1).
 - Melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA), a  growth  factor with
   potent mitogenic activity.  MGSA  is also  known  as  Neutrophil Activating
   Protein 3  (NAP-3)  or  as 'gro', as KC or N51 in mouse and as CICN in rat.
 - Macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), an extremely potent  chemotactic
   agent for polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
 - Mouse Mig (m119), a gamma-interferon induced protein that may be a cytokine
   affecting the   growth,   movement   or  activation  state  of  cells  that
   participate in immune and inflammatory response.
 - Chicken 9E3 (or pCEF-4), a protein expressed constitutively in Rous Sarcoma
   virus (RSV)  infected  cells  and  which  may  be  an autocrine factor that
   promotes the growth of fibroblasts.
 - Pig alveolar macrophage chemotactic factors I and I (AMCF-I and -II).
 - Pre-B cell growth stimulating factor (PBSF) (stromal cell-derived factor 1)
   (SDF-1).

*****************************
* TGF-beta family signature *
*****************************

Transforming growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta) [1] is  a  multifunctional peptide
that controls proliferation,  differentiation and other functions in many cell
types.  TGF-beta-1 is  a  peptide  of  112  amino  acid  residues  derived  by
proteolytic cleavage from the C-terminal of a precursor protein.   A number of
proteins are known to be related to TGF-beta-1 [1,2,3]. They are listed below.

 - Two other forms of TGF-beta have been found, they are  known as  TGF-beta-2
   and TGF-beta-3.
 - Mullerian inhibitory  substance  (MIS), produced  by  the  testis, which is
   responsible for the regression of the Mullerian ducts in the male embryo.
 - Inhibins, which inhibit the  secretion  of  follitropin  by  the  pituitary
   gland, and activins which have the reverse action. Inhibins are heterodimer
   of an  alpha  chain    and  a beta-A or a beta-B chain; activins are either
   homodimers of beta-A chains or heterodimers of a beta-A and a beta-B chain.
   All three chains are related to TGF-beta.
 - Bone morphogenetic proteins [4] BMP-2, BMP-3 (osteogenin), BMP-3B (GDF-10),
   BMP-4 (BMP-2B),  BMP-5, BMP-6  (VGR-1), BMP-7 (OP-1) and BMP-8 (OP-2) which
   induce cartilage  and bone formation and which are probably involved in the
   control of the production of skeletal structures during development.
 - Embryonic  growth  factor  GDF-1,  which  may  mediate cell differentiation
   events during embryonic development.
 - Growth/development  factor GDF-5 [5], a protein whose gene, when mutated in
   mice, is  the  cause of brachypodism, a defects which alters the length and
   numbers of bones in the limbs.
 - Growth/development factor GDF-3, GDF-6, GDF-7, GDF-8 (myostatin) and GDF-9.
 - Mouse protein nodal, which seems essential for mesoderm formation.
 - Chicken  dorsalin-1  (dsl-1) which may regulate cell differentiation within
   the neural tube.
 - Xenopus vegetal hemisphere protein Vg1, which seems to induce the overlying
   animal pole cells to form mesodermal tissue.
 - Drosophila  decapentaplegic  protein (DPP-C),  which  participates  in  the
   establishment of dorsal-ventral specification.
 - Drosophila protein screw (scw) which also participates in the establishment
   of dorsal-ventral specification.
 - Drosophila protein 60A.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans larval development regulatory growth factor daf-7.
 - Mammalian endometrial bleeding-associated factor (EBAF) (Lefty).
 - Mammalian  glial  cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a distantly
   related member  of  this  family  which  acts  as  neurotrophic  factor for
   dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra.

Proteins from  the TGF-beta  family  are  only active as homo- or heterodimer;
the two chains being linked by a single disulfide bond. From X-ray studies  of
TGF-beta-2 [6],  it  is  known that all the other cysteines  are  involved  in
intrachain  disulfide bonds.      As   shown   in   the   following  schematic
representation, there are four disulfide bonds in the TGF-betas and in inhibin
beta chains, while the other members of this family lack the first bond.

* TNF family signature and profile *
************************************

The following  cytokines  can  be  grouped  into  a  family  on  the  basis of
sequence, functional, and structural similarities [1,2,3]:

 - Tumor Necrosis  Factor (TNF)  (also  known as cachectin or TNF-alpha) [4,5]
   is a cytokine which has a wide variety of functions. It can cause cytolysis
   of certain  tumor  cell lines; it is involved in the induction of cachexia;
   it is a potent pyrogen, causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of
   interleukin-1 secretion;    finally, it  can  stimulate  cell proliferation
   and induce  cell  differentiation  under  certain conditions.
 - Lymphotoxin-alpha  (LT-alpha)  and  lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta), two related
   cytokines produced by lymphocytes and which are cytotoxic for a wide  range
   of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo [6].
 - T cell antigen gp39 (CD40L), a cytokine which  seems to be important in  B-
   cell development and activation.
 - CD27L,  a  cytokine which plays a role in T-cell activation. It induces the
   proliferation of  costimulated  T cells  and  enhances  the  generation  of
   cytolytic T cells.
 - CD30L, a cytokine which induces proliferation of T cells.
 - FASL, a cytokine involved in cell death [7].
 - 4-1BBL,  a  inducible  T  cell  surface molecule that contributes to T-cell
   stimulation.
 - OX40L,  a  cytokine  that  co-stimulates  T cell proliferation and cytokine
   production [8].
 - TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) [9], a  cytokine that induces
   apoptosis [9].

TNF-alpha is  synthesized  as  a type II membrane protein which then undergoes
post-translational cleavage liberating the extracellular domain. CD27L, CD30L,
CD40L, FASL,  LT-beta,  4-1BBL  and  TRAIL  also appear to be type II membrane
proteins. LT-alpha  is  a  secreted protein. All these cytokines  seem to form
homotrimeric (or heterotrimeric in the case of LT-alpha/beta) complexes that
are recognized by their specific receptors.

As a    signature   for  this  family  of  proteins, we have selected the most
conserved region.    This  region  is  located in a beta-strand in the central
section of these proteins

* Wnt-1 family signature *
**************************

Wnt-1 (previously  known  as  int-1)  [1]  is  a proto-oncogene induced by the
integration of  the mouse mammary tumor virus. It is thought to play a role in
intercellular communication and seems to be a signalling molecule important in
the development  of the central nervous system (CNS). The sequence of wnt-1 is
highly conserved in mammals, fish, and amphibians.

Wnt-1 is  a  member of a large family of related proteins [2,3,4] that are all
thought to  be  developmental  regulators.  These  proteins are known as wnt-2
(also known as irp), wnt-3 up to wnt-15. At least four members of  this family
are present  in  Drosophila;  one  of  them,  wingless  (wg), is implicated in
segmentation polarity.

All these  proteins  share the following features characteristics of secretory
proteins: a  signal  peptide,  several  potential N-glycosylation sites and 22
conserved cysteines  that  are  probably  involved in disulfide bonds. The Wnt
proteins seem  to adhere to the plasma membrane of the secreting cells and are
therefore likely to signal over only few cell diameters.

We selected a highly conserved region including three cysteines as a signature
for this family of proteins.

[2] and gamma. Except for gamma-interferon, the sequence of all the others are
related.  Once the  signal  peptide  has  been  removed, these interferons are
mature proteins of 160 to 170 residues.

A disulfide bond  is  one  of  the  best  conserved structural features of the

* Interleukin-1 signature *

Interleukin-1 (IL-1)  [1,2,3]  is  a  member of a family of cellular mediators
known as   cytokines.   IL-1  has  many  biological  activities.  Among  other
functions, it  is  a  fever-producing  factor (pyrogen), induces prostaglandin
synthesis, is involved in T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation as well as
in B-lymphocyte activation and proliferation via interleukin-2.

There are  two    different   forms  of IL-1: IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta,  whose
sequence are  about  25%  identical.    IL-1  alpha  and beta bind to the same
receptor. Both  forms  of  IL-1 are synthesized as precursor proteins of about
270 residues  which are then post-translationally processed by the cleavage of
a N-terminal sequence of approximately 115 residues.

The interleukin-1  receptor  antagonist  (IL-1ra)  is  a  protein structurally
related to IL-1's but whose biological function is not yet known.

As a signature pattern for  these cytokines, we selected a conserved region in
the C-terminal section.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) [1,2] is a  cytokine that  plays  a  central  role in the
control and   regulation of  the  immune and  inflammatory system.  IL-4  is a
participant in several B-cell activation processes.  It  also stimulates other
cell types  such  as  T cells or mast cells. IL-4 is a glycoprotein  of 110 to
131 residues.  It  contains  three  disulfide  bonds.    The position of these
disulfide bonds  is  not  highly  conserved  since the topology of two of them
differs in Human and mouse IL-4 [3].

Interleukin-13 [4] (IL-13) is a recently discovered pleiotropic cytokine which
may be important in  the regulation  of the inflammatory and immune responses.
IL-13 is a glycoprotein of 110 residues.

The sequence of IL-4 and IL-13 are distantly related.  As a signature  pattern
we selected the best conserved region  which  is  located  in  the  N-terminal
part of these proteins. This  region contains  a  cysteine  which, in IL-4, is

************************************************
* Interleukin-6 / G-CSF / MGF family signature *
************************************************

The following cytokines  can  be grouped  into a single family on the basis of
sequence similarities.

 - Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [1] (also known as B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2)
   or interferon beta-2) is a cytokine that has a wide variety  of  biological
   functions.  It  plays  an essential role in the final differentiation of B-
   cells into  IG-secreting    cells, as well as inducing myeloma/plasmacytoma
   growth, nerve    cell  differentiation  and,  in   hepatocytes, acute phase
   reactants.
 - Granulocyte  colony-stimulating  factor (G-CSF) [2] belongs to the cytokine
   family whose  members  regulate   hematopoietic   cell   proliferation  and
   differentiation. G-CSF  exclusively  stimulates  the  colony  formation  of
   granulocytes.
 - Myelomonocytic growth factor (MGF) [3]  is  an  avian  hematopoeitic growth
   factor that stimulates the proliferation and colony formation of normal and
   transformed avian cells of the myeloid lineage.

These cytokines are glycoproteins of about 170 to 180 amino acid residues that
contains four conserved cysteine residues involved in two disulfide bonds [4],
as shown in the following schematic representation.

 cytokines seem to be structurally related,  the  sequence  similarity  is not
 high enough to allow the use of only one single consensus pattern.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10)  [1]  is  a  protein  that  inhibits the synthesis of a
number of  cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-3, TNF and GM-CSF produced
by activated macrophages and by helper T cells.

Structurally, IL-10  is  a  protein of about 160 amino acids that contain four
conserved cysteines involved in disulfide bonds [2].

IL-10 is highly similar to the Epstein-Barr virus BCRF1 protein which inhibits
the synthesis of gamma-interferon and to Equine herpesvirus type 2 protein E7.
It is  also similar,  but  to a lesser degree, with human protein mda-7 [3], a
protein which  has antiproliferative properties in human melanoma cells. Mda-7
only contains two of the four cysteines of IL-10.

As a pattern, we selected a region around the second cysteine of IL-10.

* LIF / OSM family signature *
******************************

On the  basis  of  functional and structural similarities, the following small
cytokines can be classified into a single family [1,2]:

 - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (also known as differentiation-stimulating
   factor). LIF is a mammalian growth factor that controls the differentiation
   and proliferation of   hematopoietic  cells  as  well  as those of  several
   other cellular lineages.
 - Oncostatin (OSM),  a growth  regulator  produced  by a  number of mammalian
   cells lines.  OSM  is capable of inhibiting  the replication of a number of
   tumor cells.

As a signature pattern for these cytokines, we selected a  conserved region in
their C-terminal section.  This  region  is  centered on a  conserved cysteine
which has been shown [3], in OSM, to be involved in a disulfide bond.

* Macrophage migration inhibitory factor family signature *
***********************************************************

A protein  called  macrophage  migration  inhibitory factor (MIF) [1] seems to
exerts an  important  role  in  host inflammatory responses. It play a pivotal
role in  the  host  response  to  endotoxic  shock  and  appears to serve as a
pituitary "stress" hormone that regulates systemic inflammatory responses. MIF
is a  secreted  protein  of  115 residues which is not processed from a larger
precursor.

D-dopachrome tautomerase  [2]  is  a  mammalian cytoplasmic enzyme involved in
melanin biosynthesis  and  that  tautomerizes  D-dopachrome  with  concomitant
decarboxylation to  give  5,6-dihydroxyindole  (DHI).  It  is a protein of 117
residues highly related to MIF.

It must be noted that MIF binds glutathione and has been said to be related to
glutathione S-transferases. This assertion has been later disproved [3].

As a  signature  pattern  for  these  proteins, we selected a conserved region
located in the central section.

Adipokinetic  hormones (AKH) [1,2] are small active peptides  produced by some
insect species.   They bring on the release of diglycerides from  the fat body
and then  stimulate  the flight muscles to use them as an energy source. Other
types of active peptides structurally related to AKH are:

 - Hypertrehalosaemic  factors (HTF), which are neuropeptides that elevate the
   level of trehalose in the hemolymph of some insects.
 - Red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), a peptide that stimulates pigment
   concentration in prawn and crab erythrophores.

These peptides  are  eight  to  ten  amino  acid  residues long. The signature
pattern to detect them  is based on the sequence of  the first eight residues,
which are common to all these peptides.

* Bombesin-like peptides family signature *
*******************************************

Bombesin-like peptides    comprise  a  large  family  of  peptides  which were
initially isolated  from amphibian skin,  where they  stimulate smooth  muscle
contraction. They  were  later  found  to  be widely  distributed in mammalian
neural and  endocrine cells.   The  amphibian peptides  which  belong to  this
family are currently classified into three subfamilies [1,2]:

 - The Bombesin group, which includes bombesin and alytesin.
 - The Ranatensin  group,  which  includes ranatensins,  litorin,  and  Rohdei
   litorin.
 - The Phyllolitorin group, which includes Leu(8)- and Phe(8)-phyllolitorins.

In mammals and birds two categories of bombesin-like peptides are known [3,4]:

 - Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which stimulates the release of gastrin as
   well as other gastrointestinal hormones.
 - Neuromedin B (NMB), a neuropeptide whose function is not yet clear.

Bombesin-like peptides, like  many other  active peptides, are  synthesized as
larger protein  precursors  that are  enzymatically converted to  their mature
forms. The  final peptides are eight to fourteen residues long. As a signature
pattern, we  have  chosen  the  last   seven residues in the C-terminal, which
are conserved and are essential for the biological activity.

Calcitonin [1] is a 32 amino acid polypeptide hormone  that causes a rapid but
short-lived drop  in the  level  of  calcium  and  phosphate in the  blood, by
promoting the  incorporation of  these ions in the bones. Alternative splicing
of the gene coding for calcitonin  produces a  distantly related peptide of 37
amino acids,  called  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide  (CGRP).  CGRP induces
vasodilatation  in  a  variety  of vessels,  including  the coronary, cerebral
and systemic  vasculature.  Its  abundance  in  the  CNS  also points toward a
neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role.

Islet amyloid  polypeptide  (IAPP)  [2]  (also  known  as  diabetes-associated
peptide (DAP),  or  amylin)  is  a  peptide of 37 amino acids that selectively
inhibits insulin-stimulated  glucose  utilization and  glycogen  deposition in
muscle, while  not  affecting adipocyte glucose metabolism. Structurally, IAPP
is closely related to CGRP.

Two conserved  cysteines  in the  N-terminal of these peptides are known to be
involved in a disulfide bond.  The C-terminal residue of all three peptides is
amidated.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)  (corticoliberin) [1] is  a hormone  from
the hypothalamus  that  regulates  the release  of  corticotropin  (ACTH) from
the pituitary  gland.  CRF is evolutionary related to a number of other active
peptides which are listed below.

 - Urocortin (Ucn) [2], a brain mammalian peptide with corticotropin-releasing
   factor activity.
 - Urotensin 1 from the urophysis of fish. Like CRF and Ucn, it  acts  in ACTH
   secretion.
 - Sauvagine from frog skin, a peptide  with a  potent hypotensive action that
   elicits a diuretic effect.
 - Diuretic  hormone (DH) (or diuretic peptide (DP) from a variety of insects.
   DH is involved in the regulation of fluid secretion [3].

All these hormones are peptides of about 40 amino acid  residues  which are C-
terminally amidated and processed from a larger precursor protein.  We derived

* Arthropod CHH/MIH/GIH neurohormones family signature *
********************************************************

Arthropod  express  a family of neuropeptides [1] which so far  consist of the
following types of neurohormones:

 - Crustacean  hyperglycemic hormone (CHH). CHH is primarily involved in blood
   sugar regulation,  but  also  plays  a  role  in the control of molting and
   reproduction.
 - Molt-inhibiting  hormone (MIH). MIH inhibits Y-organs where molting hormone
   (ecdysteroid) is  secreted. A molting cycle is initiated when MIH secretion
   diminishes or stops.
 - Gonad-inhibiting  hormone  (GIH),  also  known as vitellogenesis-inhibiting
   hormone (VIH)  because  of  its role in inhibiting vitellogenesis in female
   animals.
 - Mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone (MOIH). MOIH represses the synthesis of
   methyl farnesoate,  the  precursor  of  insect  juvenile hormone III in the
   mandibular organ.
 - Ion  transport  peptide  (ITP)  from  locust. ITP stimulates salt and water
   reabsorption and inhibits acid secretion in the ileum of the locust.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein ZC168.2.

These neurohormones are peptides of 70 to 80 residues which are processed from
larger size precursors. They contain six conserved cysteines that are involved
in disulfide bonds, as shown in the following schematic representation.

 - Chromogranin A (CGA) [2]. CGA is a protein of about 420 residues; it is the
   precursor of the  peptide pancreastatin  which  strongly  inhibits glucose-
   induced insulin release from the pancreas.
 - Secretogranin 1 (chromogranin B). A sulfated protein of about 600 residues.
 - Secretogranin 2 (chromogranin C). A sulfated protein of about 650 residues.

Apart from  their  subcellular  location  and the abundance of acidic residues
(Asp and Glu), these proteins do not share many structural similarities.  Only
one short region, located in the C-terminal section, is conserved in all these
proteins.  Chromogranins A and B share a region of high similarity in their N-
terminal section;  this  region  includes  two cysteine residues involved in a
disulfide bond.

* Galanin signature *

Galanin [1,2,3] is a neuropeptide that controls various biological activities:
it regulates  the  release growth hormone, inhibits the release of insulin and
somatostatin, contracts    smooth   muscle   of   the   gastrointestinal   and
genitourinary tract and may be involved in the control of adrenal secretion.

Galanin is  a 29 amino acid peptide processed from a larger precursor protein.
Except in  human,  galanin  is C-terminally amidated.  Its sequence is  highly
conserved and  the  first  14  residues  are  identical in all currently known
sequences. We have used this N-terminal sequence as a signature pattern.

* Gastrin / cholecystokinin family signature *
**********************************************

Gastrin and cholecystokinin  (CCK)  [1,2] are  structurally  and  functionally
related  peptide  hormones that  function  as  hormonal regulators  of various
digestive processes and feeding behaviors .   They are known to induce gastric
secretion,  stimulate  pancreatic  secretion,  increase  blood circulation and
water secretion  in  the stomach  and  intestine, and stimulate  smooth muscle
contraction.   Originally found  in the gut, these  hormones have  since  been
shown to be present in various parts of the nervous  system.   Like many other
active peptides  they  are synthesized  as larger protein precursors that  are
enzymatically  converted to their  mature forms.   They  are found in  several
molecular forms  due  to  tissue-specific  post-translational  processing.   A
number of other peptides are known to belong to the same family:

 - Caerulein [3], an  amphibian  skin  peptide,  with  a  biological  activity
   similar to that of CCK or gastrin.   There are different types of caerulein
   precursors [4] in  which a  single  or up to four copies of the peptide are
   present.
 - Leukosulfakinin I and II (LSK) [5,6] are peptides, isolated from cockroach,
   that change the frequency and amplitude of contractions of the hindgut.
 - Drosulfakinins I and II [7]  are  putative  CCK-homologs  from  Drosophila.
   Those two  peptides are  part  of a  precursor  sequence  that was isolated
   using a probe based on the sequence of CCK and LSK.
 - A chicken antrum peptide [8]  which is  a  potent stimulus of avian gastric
   acid but not of pancreatic secretion.
 - Cionin [9], a neuropeptide from the protochordate Ciona intestinalis.

The biological activity of gastrin and CCK is associated with the last five C-
terminal  residues.  One  or two  positions  downstream, there  is a conserved
sulfated tyrosine residue.  The signature pattern developed for this family of
peptides includes  the  biologically active C-terminal sequence as well as the
sulfated tyrosine.

* Glucagon / GIP / secretin / VIP family signature *
****************************************************

A number of polypeptidic hormones,  mainly  expressed  in the intestine or the
pancreas, belong to a group of structurally related peptides [1,2]. Members of
this family are:

 - Glucagon, which promotes hydrolysis of glycogen  and lipids, and raises the
   blood sugar level.
 - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a  peptide of  unknown  function processed
   from the same precursor protein as that of glucagon.
 - Glucagon-like  peptide  2  (GLP-2),   a  peptide of  unknown  function also
   processed from  the  glucagon  precursor  protein but which, in contrast to
   GLP-1, is only found in mammals.
 - Gastric inhibitory  polypeptide (GIP),  which  is a  potent  stimulator  of
   insulin  secretion  and   a   relatively  poor  inhibitor  of  gastric acid
   secretion.
 - Secretin, which stimulates formation of NaHCO(3)-rich pancreatic juice  and
   secretion of NaHCO(3)-rich bile as well as inhibiting HCl production by the
   stomach.
 - Vasoactive  intestinal  peptide (VIP), which  causes vasodilatation, lowers
   arterial blood  pressure,  stimulates  myocardial contractility,  increases
   glycogenolysis and relaxes some smooth muscles.
 - Peptide PHI-27, a vasodilator peptide which is coded by the  same precursor
   protein as that of VIP.
 - Growth  hormone-releasing factor (GRF) (also known as somatoliberin), which
   is released by the hypothalamus and acts on the adenohypophyse to stimulate
   the secretion of growth hormone.
 - Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) [3].
 - Helospectin (exendin-1),  helodermin (exendin-2),  exendin-3, and exendin-4
   from the venom of gila monsters.  The  exendins  are  peptides  with a VIP/
   secretin biological activity [4].
 - A peptide produced by the X-cells of the islets of ratfish pancreas [5].

As a pattern for this  family of peptides  (which are from 30 to 45 amino acid
residues long), we used the  more or less conserved first ten positions of the
N-terminal as well as a conserved hydrophobic residue in position 23.

The gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH) (gonadoliberin) [1,E1] are a family
of peptides  that  play  a  pivotal role in reproduction. The main function of
GnRH is  to  act  on the pituitary to stimulate the synthesis and secretion of
luteinizing  and  follicle-stimulating  hormones, but  GnRH  also  acts on the
brain, retina,  sympathetic  nervous  system, gonads  and  placenta in certain
species. There  seems  to  be at least three forms of GnRH. The second form is
expressed in midbrain and seems to be widespread. The third form has only been
found so far in fish.

GnRH is  a C-terminal  amidated  decapeptide processed from a larger precursor
protein. Four  of  the  ten  residues  are perfectly  conserved in all species
where GnRH has been sequenced.

Atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) [1,2,3] are vertebrate hormones important in
the overall control of cardiovascular homeostasis and sodium and water balance
in general.  There  are  various ANP  peptides which  vary in length but which
have a common central  core;  they  are all processed from a single precursor.
There is  a    disulfide  bond    which is important for the expression of the
biological activity.

The ANP protein family includes three additional structurally related peptides
which elicit a pharmacological spectrum similar to ANP:

 - Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
 - C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).
 - Ventricular natriuretic peptide (VNP) [4].
 - Green mamba natriuretic peptide (DNP) [5].

The signature developed for the ANP family includes the two cysteines involved

* Neurohypophysial hormones signature *
***************************************

Oxytocin (or  ocytocin)  and  vasopressin  [1]  are  small  (nine  amino  acid
residues), structurally  and  functionally  related   neurohypophysial peptide
hormones. Oxytocin  causes  contraction of the smooth muscle of the uterus and
of the mammary gland while vasopressin has a direct antidiuretic action on the
kidney  and also  causes  vasoconstriction of the   peripheral vessels.   Like
the  majority of  active peptides,  both hormones  are  synthesized  as larger
protein  precursors  that are  enzymatically converted  to their mature forms.
Peptides belonging to  this family are also found in birds, fish, reptiles and
amphibians  (mesotocin,   isotocin,   valitocin,   glumitocin,    aspargtocin,
vasotocin, seritocin,  asvatocin,  phasvatocin),  in worms (annetocin), octopi
(cephalotocin), locust (locupressin  or  neuropeptide  F1/F2)  and in molluscs
(conopressins G and S) [2].

The pattern developed  to detect this category  of peptides spans their entire
sequence and includes four invariant amino acid residues.

Neuromedin U (NmU) [1] is a vertebrate peptide which stimulates uterine smooth
muscle contraction  and  causes  selective vasoconstriction.  Like  most other
active  peptides,  it is  proteolytically  processed  from  a larger precursor
protein. The mature peptides are 8 (NmU-8) to 25 (NmU-25) residues long and C-
terminally amidated.

The sequence  of  the  C-terminal extremity of NmU is extremely well conserved
[2] in  mammals,  birds  and  amphibians. We used the last seven residues as a

* Endogenous opioids neuropeptides precursors signature *

Vertebrate endogenous opioids neuropeptides are released by post-translational
proteolytic processing of precursor proteins. These precursor proteins consist
of a  signal  sequence  followed by a conserved region of about 50 residues, a
variable length  region  and  the sequence of the various neuropeptides. Three
types of precursors are currently known:

 - Preproenkephalin  A  (gene PENK) which is processed to produce the peptides
   Met-enkephalin (6 copies) and Leu-enkephalin,
 - Preproenkephalin  B  (gene PDYN) which is processed to produce the peptides
   neoendorphin, dynorphin, leumorphin, rimorphin and leu-enkephalin.
 - Prepronocipeptin  (gene  PNOC)  which  is processed to produce the peptides
   nociceptin (orphanin FQ) as well as two other potential neuropeptides.

The conserved  region  in  the  N-terminal  of  these  precursors contains six
cysteines that  are probably involved in disulfide bonds. This region could be
important for the processing of the neuropeptides [1].

* Pancreatic hormone family signature and profile *
***************************************************

Pancreatic hormone (PP) [1] is a  peptide  synthesized in pancreatic islets of
Langherhans, which  acts    as  a regulator of pancreatic and gastrointestinal
functions.   A  number of other  active peptides  are homologous to pancreatic
hormone:

 - Neuropeptide Y (NPY)  [2],  one  of  the  most  abundant  peptides  in  the
   mammalian nervous system.  NPY is implicated in the control  of feeding and
   the secretion of the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone.
 - Peptide YY  (PYY)  [3].  PPY  is  a  gut  peptide  that  inhibits  exocrine
   pancreatic secretion, has a  vasoconstrictory  action  and inhibits jejunal
   and colonic mobility.
 - Various NPY and PYY-like polypeptides from fish and amphibians [4,5].
 - Neuropeptide F (NPF) from invertebrates such as worms and snail [6].
 - Skin  peptide Tyr-Tyr (SPYY) from the frog Phyllomedusa bicolor. SPYY shows
   a large spectra of antibacterial and antifungal activity.

All these  peptides  are 36 to 39 amino acids long. Like most active peptides,
their C-terminal  is  amidated  and  they  are  synthesized  as larger protein
precursors. The  signature  for  these  peptides  is  based  on the last 17 C-
terminal residues,  where  three positions are completely conserved. A profile
was also developed that spans the whole peptide.

* Parathyroid hormone family signature *
****************************************

Parathyroid hormone (PTH)  is  a  polypeptidic  hormone  that elevates calcium
level  by  dissolving  the salts in bone and preventing their renal excretion.
PTH is a protein of about 80 amino acid  residues, but its biological activity
seems to be contained within the first 34 residues.

PTH is structurally related  to  a protein called 'parathyroid hormone-related
protein' (PTH-rP) [1]  which seems to play a  physiological role in lactation,
possibly as a hormone  for the  mobilization and/or transfer of calcium to the
milk.  PTH-rP is  a  protein  of  141  amino  acids.  As for PTH, the first 34
residues are sufficient to mediate the biological activity of PTH-rP.  PTH and
PTH-rP bind to the same G-protein coupled receptor.

The signature pattern we selected for these proteins is derived from conserved
residues in the N-terminal extremity of PTH and PTH-rP, spanning residues 2 to
12.

Pyrokinins are insect neuropeptides that mediate  visceral  muscle contractile
activity (myotropic  activity)  [1].  The  pyrokinins  are peptides of 8 to 16
amino acids  that share the amide-blocked C-terminal sequence Phe-Xaa-Pro-Arg-
Leu-NH2, where  Xaa  is  either  Gly,  Ser, Thr, or Val.  This pentapeptide is
sufficient  to  elicit a significant myotropic activity.   The same C-terminal
sequence is present in the following insect neuropeptides:

 - Pheromone biosynthesis activating  neuropeptide (PBAN).  PBAN  is a hormone
   that controls    sex    pheromone  production  in  female moths  as well as
   eliciting pyrokinin-like myotropic activity.
 - Pheromonotropin [2], from Pseudaletia separata,  which  also  controls  sex
   pheromone production.

Tachykinins [1,2,3] are  a group of biologically active peptides  which excite
neurons, evoke behavioral  responses, are potent vasodilatators  and  contract
(directly or  indirectly) many smooth muscles. Peptides known to belong to the
tachykinin family are listed below:

 - Substance P from mammals, birds and fish.
 - Neurokinin A (substance K or neuromedin L) from mammals, birds and fish.
 - Neurokinin B (neuromedin K) from mammals and frogs.

 - Carassin from goldfish [5].
 - Eledoisin from octopus.

Tachykinins,  like  most  other  active  peptides, are  synthesized  as larger

Tachykinins  are  from ten  to  twelve residues  long.  We use, as a signature

essential to the biological activity.

Thymosin beta-4 [1] is a  polypeptide of  43 amino  acid residues whose  exact
physiological role is not yet known.   It  was  first  isolated  as  a  thymic
hormone that induces terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. It is found in high
quantity in thymus and spleen  but  is  widely distributed in many tissues. It
has also  been  shown  to  bind  to  actin  monomers and thus to inhibit actin
polymerization [2].

The sequence of thymosin beta-4 is extremely  well  conserved  in  mammals and
amphibians.  A number of peptides closely related to thymosin beta-4 are known
to exist [3,4]: thymosin beta-9 (and beta-8) in bovine and pig, thymosin beta-
10 in man and rat, thymosin beta-11 and beta-12 in trout and human Nb thymosin
beta.

As a  signature  pattern  for this family, we selected  a stretch of 11 highly
conserved residues located  in the central part of the thymosin beta proteins.
This region,  rich  in  charged  residues  (4 Lys and 2 Glu), lies between two
alpha-helical regions [5] and could be involved in the binding of actin [2].

Defensins [1   to   5],  also  known  as  alpha-defensins,  are  a  family  of
structurally related  cysteine-rich peptides active against many Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped  viruses.  Some defensins are
also called corticostatins (CS) because they inhibit  corticotropin-stimulated
corticosteroid production.  Defensins kills cells by forming voltage-regulated
multimeric channels   in   the   susceptible  cell's  membrane.  They  play  a
significant role in innate immunity  to  infection and neoplasia. The peptides
known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Rabbit defensins and  corticostatins:  CS-I (NP-3A),  CS-II (NP-3B), CS-III
   (MCP-1), CS-IV (MCP-2), NP-4, and NP-5.
 - Guinea-pig neutrophil defensin (GPNP).
 - Human neutrophil defensins 1 to 4 and intestinal defensins 5 and 6.
 - Mouse small bowel cryptdins 1 to 5.
 - Rat NP-1 to NP-4.

All these peptides range in length from 29 to 35 amino acids.  There are seven
invariant  residues,  including   six  cysteines  all  involved  in intrachain
disulfide bonds.     A schematic  representation of peptides from the defensin

*********************************
* Arthropod defensins signature *
*********************************

Arthropod defensins   are  a  family  of  insect  and  scorpion  cysteine-rich
antibacterial peptides,  primarily active  against Gram-positive bacteria. The
peptides known to belong to this family are listed below.

 - Phormicin A and B from black blowfly (Phormia terranovae) [1].
 - Royalisin from the royal jelly of honey bee [2].
 - Sapecin, sapecin B and sapecin C from flesh fly (Sarcophaga peregrina) [3].
 - Antibacterial peptides B and C from the beetle Zophobas atratus [4].
 - Defensin from the larva of the dragonfly Aeschna cyanea [5].
 - Defensin from Pyrrhocoris apterus [6].
 - 4 Kd defensin from the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus [7].

All  these  peptides range in length from 38 to 51 amino acids.  There are six
conserved cysteines all  involved  in intrachain disulfide bonds.  A schematic
representation of peptides from the arthropod defensin family is shown below.

* Cathelicidins signatures *
****************************

The precursor  sequences  of  a  number  of antimicrobial peptides secreted by
neutrophils (polymorphonuclear  leukocytes) upon activation have been found to
be evolutionarily  related  and  are  collectively known as cathelicidins [1].
This family includes:

 - Pig cathelin, which may be the precursor of an antibacterial peptide.
 - Bovine  and  sheep  bactenecin 5 (Bac5) and 7 (Bac7), proline and arginine-
   rich antibiotics.
 - Bovine and sheep cyclic dodecapeptide, a potent antibiotic.
 - Bovine indolicidin, a tryptophan-rich potent antibiotic.
 - Rabbit  CAP18, a  protein  that  binds to the bacterial lipopolysaccharides
   (LPS) and which also has antibiotic activity.
 - Human FALL-39 (or LL-37), an antibacterial LPS-binding peptide.
 - Rabbit p15,  which  also  binds  to  LPS  and  modulates the  antibacterial
   activity of BPI.
 - Pig antibacterial peptide PR-39.
 - Bovine myeloid antibacterial peptides BMAP-27 and BMAP-28.
 - Pig myeloid antibacterial peptides PMAP-23, PMAP-36 and PMAP-37.
 - Pig protegrin-1 to -5.
 - Sheep myeloid antibacterial peptide SMAP-29 (SC-5).
 - Mouse CRAMP (CLP).

Structurally, these  proteins  consist  of three domains: a signal sequence, a
conserved region  of  about 100 residues that contains four cysteines involved
in two disulfide bonds, and a  highly divergent C-terminal section of variable
size. It  is  in  this  C-terminal section that the antibacterial peptides are
found; they are proteolytically processed from their precursor by enzymes such
as elastase.   This   structure   is   shown   in   the   following  schematic
representation:

Endothelins (ET's) are a family  of  potent mammalian vasoconstrictor peptides
[1,2,3]. Sarafotoxins (SRTX) and bibrotoxin (BTX) are  cardiotoxins  from  the
venom of snakes of the Atractaspis family, structurally and functionally [4,5]
similar to  endothelin.  The  peptides  currently  known  to  belonging to the
ET/SRTX family are:

 - Endothelin 1 (ET-1).
 - Endothelin 2 (ET-2) which  is  also known in mouse as Vasoactive Intestinal
   Contractor (VIC).
 - Endothelin 3 (ET-3).
 - Sarafotoxins SRTX-A, -B, -C and -D from Atractaspis engaddensis.
 - Bibrotoxin (BTX) from Atractaspis bibroni.

As shown in the  following schematic  representation, these peptides which are
21 residues long contain two intramolecular disulfide bonds.

Thionins are small, basic, plant proteins generally toxic to animal cells [1].
They seem to exert  their  toxic effect  at the level of the cell membrane but
their exact  function  is  not  known. They consist of a polypeptide chain  of
forty five  to  fifty amino acids with three to four internal disulfide bonds.
They are found in seeds but also in the cell wall of leaves [2]. Thionins  are
processed from larger precursor proteins [3]. Crambin [4], a hydrophobic plant
seed protein,  also belongs to this family. The pattern we developed to detect
this family  of  proteins includes three of the six cysteine residues involved
in disulfide bonds.

The following small plant proteins are evolutionary related:

 - Gamma-thionins from wheat endosperm (gamma-purothionins) and barley (gamma-
   hordothionins) which   are  toxic  to  animal  cells  and  inhibit  protein
   synthesis in cell free systems [1].
 - A flower-specific thionin (FST) from tobacco [2].
 - Antifungal proteins (AFP) from  the seeds  of Brassicaceae  species such as
   radish, mustard, turnip and Arabidopsis thaliana [3].
 - Inhibitors of insect alpha-amylases from sorghum [4].
 - Probable protease inhibitor P322 from potato.
 - A germination-related protein from cowpea [5].
 - Anther-specific protein  SF18  from sunflower [6].  SF18 is a  protein that
   contains a  gamma-thionin  domain  at  its N-terminus and a proline-rich C-
   terminal domain.
 - Soybean sulfur-rich protein SE60 [7].
 - Vicia faba antibacterial peptides fabatin-1 and -2.

In their  mature  form,  these  proteins  generally  consist of about 45 to 50

* Snake toxins signature *

Snake toxins belong to  a  family of  proteins [1,2,3]  which groups short and
long neurotoxins, cytotoxins and short toxins, as well as a other miscellanous
venom peptides.  Most  of  these  toxins  act  by  binding  to  the  nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors  in  the postsynaptic membrane of skeletal muscles and
prevent the  binding  of  acetylcholine,  thereby  blocking  the excitation of
muscles.

Snake toxins  are  proteins that consist of sixty to seventy five amino acids.
Among the  invariant  residues  are  eight cysteines all involved in disulfide
bonds. A  signature  pattern  was  developed  [4] which includes four of these
cysteines as    well  as  a  conserved proline thought to be important for the
maintenance of the tertiary structure.   The second cysteine in the pattern is
linked to the third one by a disulfide bond.

Myotoxins [1] are small basic  peptides (42 to 45 residues) from  the venom of
rattlesnakes that  cause severe  muscle necrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism.
Myotoxins act  extremely  rapidly  and serve two primary biological functions:
limiting the  flight  of  prey by causing instantaneous  paralysis of the hind
limbs and promoting rapid death by paralysis of the diaphragm.

Myotoxins contain six cysteines involved in three disulfide bonds  as shown in

* Aerolysin type toxins signature *
***********************************

Aerolysin [1]  is a cytolytic  toxin  exported  by the Gram-negative Aeromonas
bacteria.    The mature toxin binds to eukaryotic cells and aggregates to form
holes  (approximately 3 nm in  diameter)  leading  to the  destruction  of the
membrane permeability barrier  and osmotic lysis.   Staphylococcus aureus also
exports a cytotoxin, alpha-toxin [2], whose biological activity  is similar to
that of aerolysin.  The sequences of  both toxins are not similar except for a
stretch of ten residues rather well conserved.

-Note: Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin [3] has been said to contain a  region
 whose sequence is similar to that of the conserved domain of areolysin/alpha-
 toxin, but the similarity is very weak and this toxin is not picked up by the

*******************************************************************
* Shiga/ricin ribosomal inactivating toxins active site signature *
*******************************************************************

A number of bacterial and plant toxins act by  inhibiting protein synthesis in
eukaryotic cells.  The toxins  of  the Shiga  and ricin  family inactivate 60S
ribosomal  subunits  by an N-glycosidic  cleavage  which  releases a  specific
adenine base from the sugar-phosphate backbone of 28S rRNA [1,2,3]. The toxins
which are known to function in this manner are:

 - Shiga toxin from Shigella dysenteriae [4].  This toxin is  composed  of one
   copy of  an  enzymatically  active A subunit and five copies of a B subunit
   responsible  for  binding the    toxin complex to specific receptors on the
   target cell surface.
 - Shiga-like  toxins  (SLT)  are    a group  of Escherichia  coli toxins very
   similar in  their  structure and properties to Shiga toxin. The sequence of
   two types of these toxins, SLT-1 [5] and SLT-2 [6], is known.
 - Ricin, a  potent toxin  from castor bean  seeds.   Ricin  consists  of  two
   glycosylated  chains  linked   by   a  disulfide  bond.   The  A  chain  is
   enzymatically active. The B chain is a lectin with a binding preference for
   galactosides. Both chains  are  encoded by a single polypeptidic precursor.
   Ricin is classified as a type-II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP); other
   members of this family  are agglutinin, also  from  castor  bean, and abrin
   from the seeds of the bean Abrus precatorius [7].
 - Single  chain  ribosome-inactivating   proteins (type-I RIP)  from  plants.
   Examples of such proteins are:  barley  protein  synthesis inhibitors I and
   II, mongolian  snake-gourd  trichosanthin,  sponge  gourd  luffin-A and -B,
   garden four-o'clock MAP, common pokeberry PAP-S and soapwort saporin-6 [7].

All these toxins are  structurally related.  A conserved  glutamic residue has
been implicated [8] in the catalytic mechanism; it is located near a conserved
arginine which also plays a role in catalysis [9].  The signature we developed
for these proteins includes these catalytic residues.

**************************************
* Channel forming colicins signature *
**************************************

Colicins   are plasmid-encoded  polypeptide    toxins  produced by and  active
against Escherichia coli and  closely related bacteria.    The channel-forming
colicins are transmembrane proteins that depolarize the  cytoplasmic membrane,
leading to dissipation  of  cellular energy [1,2].  Colicins A, B, E1, Ia, Ib,
and N belong to that group. The N-terminal part of these colicins  is involved
in their uptake; the central part is important for  binding to outer  membrane
receptors and the C-terminal part is the channel-forming region.

As a signature for  this type  of  colicins, we  have selected one of the most
conserved region of the channel-forming domain.

* Hok/gef family cell toxic proteins signature *
************************************************

In Gram-negative bacteria there is a family of very small proteins which, when
overexpressed, kill the cells  from the  inside  by  interfering  with a vital
function in the cell membrane [1]. The proteins known to belong to this family
are:

 - Escherichia coli chromosomal protein gef.
 - Escherichia coli chromosomal protein relF.
 - Plasmid F protein flmA.
 - Plasmid F protein srnB.
 - Plasmid R1 protein hok.
 - Plasmids R16 and R483 protein pndA.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybdY.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ydcB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yiaZ [3].

These proteins  consist  of 49 to 68 amino acids.  Their N-terminal section is
hydrophobic and  seems  [3]  to form  a membrane-spanning region, while the C-
terminal part  is  located in  the  periplasm  and  contains the toxic domain.
Two cysteines  are conserved, one  in the N-terminal part and the other in the
C-terminal part;  in the gef protein, this second cysteine  has been shown [3]
to be involved in the formation of a disulfide bond between two monomers.

As a signature pattern we  selected the region  that  contains  the end of the
membrane-spanning region and ends with the second cysteine.

* Staphylococcal enterotoxins / Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins signatures *
******************************************************************************

Staphylococcal enterotoxins and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins constitute a
family of   biologically   and   structurally   related   toxins  produced  by
Staphylococcus aureus and  Streptococcus  pyogenes [1,2].  These  toxins share
the ability  to bind to the major histocompatibility complex proteins of their
hosts. The toxins that belong to this family are:

 - Staphylococcal enterotoxins are  the cause of staphylococcal food poisoning
   syndrome.  The sequence  of six  different enterotoxins is known: SEA, SEB,
   SEC1, SEC3, SED, and SEE.
 - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins  are the causative agents of the symptoms
   associated with scarlet fever.  The sequence  of two pyrogenic exotoxins is
   known: SPEA, and SPEC.
 - Staphylococcus aureus toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1).

While the enterotoxins and the pyrogenic exotoxins are closely related, TSST-1
seems to be only distantly  related  to  the other toxins.  We  developed  two
patterns for this family of toxins. The first one is based on a well conserved
region of enterotoxins and pyrogenic exotoxins,  but  which  does  not pick up
TSST-1; the second pattern is derived from a more diffuse region of similarity
common to all these toxins.

Thiol-activated cytolysins  [1,2]  are  toxins  produced by a variety of Gram-
positive bacteria and are  characterized by their ability to lyse cholesterol-
containing membranes,  their reversible inactivation  by  oxidation  and their
capacity to  bind  to  cholesterol.  The  sequences of some of these toxins is
currently known:

 - Alveolysin (gene alv) from Bacillus alvei.
 - Ivanolysin (gene ilo) from Listeria ivanovii.
 - Listeriolysin O (gene hlyA) from Listeria monocytogenes.
 - Perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) (gene pfo) from Clostridium perfringens.
 - Pneumolysin (gene ply) from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 - Seeligeriolysin (gene lso) from Listeria seeligeri.
 - Streptolysin O (gene slo) from Streptococcus pyogenes.

All these  proteins contain  a  single  cysteine  residue, located in their C-
terminal section,  which  has  been  shown [3] to be essential for the binding
to cholesterol. This cysteine is located in a highly conserved region that can
be used as a signature pattern.

* Membrane attack complex components / perforin signature *
***********************************************************

The membrane-attack complex (MAC) of the complement system forms transmembrane
channels.  These  channels  disrupt  the phospholipid bilayer of target cells,
leading to cell lysis and death [1,2]. A number of proteins participate in the
assembly  of the  MAC.  Freshly  activated  C5b  binds  to  C6 to form a C5b-6
complex,  then to C7 forming the C5b-7 complex. The C5b-7 complex binds to C8,
which is  composed of  three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), thus forming the
C5b-8 complex.  C5b-8  subsequently  binds to C9 and acts as a catalyst in the
polymerization of  C9.  Active  MAC has a subunit composition of C5b-C6-C7-C8-
C9{n}.

Perforin [2,3] is a protein found in cytolytic T-cell and killer cells. In the
presence of calcium,  perforin polymerizes  into transmembrane tubules  and is
capable of lysing, non-specifically, a variety of target cells.

There are a  number of  regions  of similarity  in the sequences of complement
components C6,  C7,  C8-alpha,  C8-beta,  C9  and perforin. As a signature for
these proteins, we have selected the best  conserved of these regions, located
in a probable membrane-spanning segment [4].

In addition to the prototype sequence  for this type of inhibitor - the bovine
pancreatic  trypsin  inhibitor (BPTI)  (also known as basic protease inhibitor
(BPI)) -  this family also includes many other members which are  listed below
(references are only provided for recently determined sequences):

 - Mammalian  inter-alpha-trypsin  inhibitors  (ITI).    ITI's   contain   two
   inhibitory domains.
 - Tissue  factor  pathway  inhibitor  precursor  (TFPI)  (previously known as
   lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI)), which inhibits factor
   X (Xa) directly and, in a Xa-dependent way,  inhibits VIIa / Tissue  factor
   activity. TFPI contains three inhibitory domains.
 - TFPI-2  [4]  (also  known  as placental protein 5), a protein that contains
   two inhibitory domains.
 - Bovine colostrum, serum and spleen trypsin inhibitors.
 - Trypstatin, a rat mast cell inhibitor of trypsin.
 - A number of venom basic protease  inhibitors  (including dendrotoxins) from
   snakes.
 - Isoinhibitor K from garden snail.
 - Protease inhibitor from the hemocytes of horseshoe crab.
 - Basic protease inhibitor from red sea turtle.
 - Sea anemone protease inhibitor 5 II.
 - Chymotrypsin inhibitors SCI-I,- II, and -III from silk moth.
 - Trypsin inhibitors A and B from the hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm.
 - Trypsin inhibitor from the hemolymph of the flesh fly [5].
 - Acrosin inhibitor from the male accessory gland of Drosophila.

 - A domain found in  one of the alternatively spliced  forms  of  Alzheimer's
   amyloid beta-protein (APP) (also known as protease nexin II) as well as the
   closely related amyloid-like protein 2 (or APPH).
 - A domain at the C-terminal  extremity  of  the  alpha(3)  chain  of type VI
   collagen.
 - A domain at the C-terminal  extremity  of  the  alpha(1)  chain of type VII

* Soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) protease inhibitors family signature *
***************************************************************************

The soybean trypsin  inhibitor (Kunitz)  family  [1]  is one  of  the numerous
families of  proteinase  inhibitors.  It  comprise  plant  proteins which have
inhibitory activity against serine proteinases from the trypsin and subtilisin
families, thiol proteinases and aspartic proteinases as well  as some proteins
that are  probably involved in seed storage. This family is currently known to
group the following proteins:

 - Trypsin inhibitors A, B, C, KTI1, and KTI2 from soybean.
 - Trypsin inhibitor DE3 from coral beans (Erythrina sp.).
 - Trypsin inhibitor DE5 from sandal bead tree.
 - Trypsin inhibitors 1A (WTI-1A), 1B (WTI-1B), and 2 (WTI-2) from goa bean.
 - Trypsin inhibitor from Acacia confusa.
 - Trypsin inhibitor from silk tree.
 - Chymotrypsin inhibitor 3 (WCI-3) from goa bean.
 - Cathepsin D  inhibitors  PDI  and  NDI from  potato [2], which inhibit both
   cathepsin D (aspartic proteinase) and trypsin.
 - Alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitors from barley and wheat.
 - Albumin-1 (WBA-1) from goa bean seeds [3].
 - Miraculin from Richadella dulcifica [4], a sweet taste protein.
 - Sporamin from sweet potato [5], the major tuberous root protein.
 - Thiol proteinase inhibitor PCPI 8.3 (P340) from potato tuber [6].
 - Wound responsive protein gwin3 from poplar tree [7].
 - 21 Kd seed protein from cocoa [8].

All these proteins contain from 170 to 200 amino acid residues  and one or two
intrachain disulfide  bonds.  The  best  conserved region is found in their N-
terminal section and is used as a signature pattern.

*********************
* Serpins signature *
*********************

Serpins (SERine  Proteinase INhibitors) [1,2,3,4]  are a group of structurally
related proteins.    They  are high molecular weight (400 to 500 amino acids),
extracellular,  irreversible  serine protease  inhibitors  with a well defined
structural-functional characteristic:  a reactive region that acts as a 'bait'
for an  appropriate  serine  protease.  This region is found in the C-terminal
part of  these  proteins.     Proteins which are known to belong to the serpin
family are  listed below (references are only provided for recently determined
sequences):

 - Alpha-1 protease inhibitor (alpha-1-antitrypsin, contrapsin).
 - Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin,
 - Antithrombin III.
 - Alpha-2-antiplasmin.
 - Heparin cofactor II.
 - Complement C1 inhibitor.
 - Plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 (PAI-1) and 2 (PAI-2).
 - Glia derived nexin (GDN) (Protease nexin I).
 - Protein C inhibitor.
 - Rat hepatocytes SPI-1, SPI-2 and SPI-3 inhibitors.
 - Human  squamous  cell  carcinoma  antigen  (SCCA)  which  may  act  in  the
   modulation of the host immune response against tumor cells.
 - A lepidopteran protease inhibitor.
 - Leukocyte elastase inhibitor  which, in  contrast  to  other serpins, is an
   intracellular protein.
 - Neuroserpin  [5],  a  neuronal  inhibitor  of  plasminogen  activators  and
   plasmin.
 - Cowpox  virus  crmA  [6], an inhibitor of the thiol protease interleukin-1B
   converting enzyme  (ICE).  CrmA  is the only serpin known to inhibit a non-
   serine proteinase.
 - Some orthopoxviruses probable protease inhibitors, which may be involved in
   the regulation  of  the  blood  clotting  cascade  and/or of the complement
   cascade in the mammalian host.

On the  basis  of  strong  sequence similarities, a number of proteins with no
known inhibitory activity are said to belong to this family:

 - Birds ovalbumin and the related genes X and Y proteins.
 - Angiotensinogen; the precursor of the angiotensin active peptide.
 - Barley protein Z; the major endosperm albumin.
 - Corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG).
 - Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).
 - Sheep uterine  milk protein (UTMP) and pig  uteroferrin-associated  protein
   (UFAP).
 - Hsp47, an endoplasmic reticulum heat-shock protein that  binds  strongly to
   collagen and could act  as a chaperone in the collagen biosynthetic pathway
   [7].
 - Maspin, which seems to function as a tumor supressor [5].
 - Pigment epithelium-derived factor precursor (PEDF), a protein with a strong
   neutrophic activity [8].
 - Ep45, an estrogen-regulated protein from Xenopus [9].

We developed  a signature pattern for  this family of  proteins, centered on a
well conserved Pro-Phe sequence  which is found ten to fifteen residues on the
C-terminal side of the reactive bond.

-Consensus pattern: [LIVMFY]-x-[LIVMFYAC]-[DNQ]-[RKHQS]-[PST]-F-[LIVMFY]-
                    [LIVMFYC]-x-[LIVMFAH]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 7 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: 21.

-Note: in position 6 of the pattern, Pro is found in most serpins.

The potato inhibitor I family  is  one of  the   numerous families  of  serine
proteinase  inhibitors.    Members of this protein family are found in plants;
in the seeds of  barley or beans [1,2,3], and in potato or tomato leaves where
they accumulate in response to mechanical damage [4,5]. An inhibitor belonging
to this family  is also found  in  leech [6].  It is interesting to note that,
currently, this  is the  only proteinase  inhibitor family to be found both in
plant and animal kingdoms.

Structurally these inhibitors  are  small (60 to 90 residues)  and in contrast
with other  families of protease inhibitors, they lack  disulfide bonds.  They
have a  single inhibitory site.  The consensus  pattern  we developed includes
three out of the four residues conserved in all members  of this family and is
located in the N-terminal half.

 very weak similarity with the other members of this family.

Inhibitors of cysteine  proteases [1,2,3],  which are found in the tissues and
body fluids of animals,  in the larva of the worm Onchocerca volvulus [4],  as
well as in plants, can be grouped into three distinct but related families:

 - Type 1 cystatins (or stefins), molecules of  about 100 amino  acid residues
   with neither disulfide bonds nor carbohydrate groups.
 - Type 2 cystatins, molecules of about 115  amino acid residues which contain
   one or two disulfide loops near their C-terminus.
 - Kininogens, which are  multifunctional  plasma glycoproteins.  They are the
   precursor  of  the  active  peptide  bradykinin  and  play  a role in blood
   coagulation by  helping  to  position optimally prekallikrein and factor XI
   next  to factor XII.  They  are  also  inhibitors  of  cysteine  proteases.
   Structurally,  kininogens  are  made  of  three  contiguous type-2 cystatin
   domains, followed  by an  additional  domain  (of  variable  length)  which
   contains  the  sequence of bradykinin.  The  first  of  the  three cystatin
   domains seems to have lost its inhibitory activity.

In all  these  inhibitors,  there is a conserved region of five residues which
has been proposed to be  important for  the binding to the cysteine proteases.
Our pattern starts one residue before this conserved region.

* Alpha-2-macroglobulin family thiolester region signature *
************************************************************

The proteinase-binding alpha-macroglobulins (A2M) [1] are  large glycoproteins
found in the plasma of vertebrates, in  the  hemolymph  of  some invertebrates
and in  reptilian and avian egg white.  A2M-like  proteins are able to inhibit
all four  classes  of  proteinases  by  a  'trapping' mechanism.  They have  a
peptide  stretch,  called  the 'bait region', which contains specific cleavage
sites for different proteinases.  When a proteinase cleaves the bait region, a
conformational change is induced in the protein, thus trapping the proteinase.
The entrapped enzyme  remains active  against low molecular weight substrates,
whilst its  activity    toward   larger  substrates is greatly reduced, due to
steric hindrance.   Following cleavage in the bait region, a thiol ester bond,
formed between the side chains of a  cysteine and  a glutamine, is cleaved and
mediates the covalent binding of the A2M-like protein to the proteinase.

The proteins which are known to belong to this family are:

 - Alpha-2-macroglobulin from mammals, lobster, and crayfish.
 - Alpha-1-inhibitor III from rat.
 - Pregnancy zone protein (PZP) from human.
 - Ovostatin from birds.

 - Complement components C3,  C4  and  C5.   These  proteins  do  not  inhibit
   proteinases.  C3 plays a  central role in the  activation of both classical
   and alternative complement pathways.  After C3 is  cleaved to  form C3b, it
   can bind covalently,  via its  reactive  thiol ester bond,  to cell surface
   carbohydrates  or immune aggregates.  Similarily C4, once activated to C4b,
   can bind to various molecules.

As a  signature  pattern  for  this  family  of proteins, we have selected the
region containing the two residues involved in the thiol ester bond.

* Lambdoid phages regulatory protein CIII signature *
*****************************************************

The lambdoid phage  regulatory  protein  CIII [1] is  a   very  small  protein
whose presence  in  the  cell  results  in   the   stabilization  of  the  CII
transcriptional activator, a usually very unstable protein. The stabilized CII
protein is then able to activate CI, the gene  for the repressor protein which
prevents the transcription  of  proteins necessary  for  lytic development and
thus promotes the establishment of lysogeny.

The exact mechanism of  the  action of CIII on the stability of CII is not yet
known, although it has been proposed  that  CIII  acts  as  an  inhibitor of a
protease that degrades CII.

It has been shown that a region of 22 residues, located in the central part of
various lambdoid  phage  CIII's,  is the region of highest sequence similarity
and sufficient  for   the  activity of the protein.  We have derived a pattern
from this region.

* Chaperonins cpn60 signature *
*******************************

Chaperonins [1,2] are  proteins  involved in  the  folding  of proteins or the
assembly of oligomeric protein complexes.  Their  role seems to be  to  assist
other  polypeptides to  maintain  or assume  conformations  which permit their
correct assembly into oligomeric structures.  They  are found in abundance  in
prokaryotes,  chloroplasts  and  mitochondria.   Chaperonins  form  oligomeric
complexes and  are  composed  of  two  different  types  of  subunits: a 60 Kd
protein, known  as  cpn60  (groEL  in  bacteria) and a 10 Kd protein, known as
cpn10 (groES in bacteria).

The cpn60 protein shows weak ATPase activity and is a highly conserved protein
of about 550 to 580 amino acid  residues which has been described by different
names in different species:

 - Escherichia coli groEL protein,  which  is essential for the  growth of the
   bacteria and the assembly of several bacteriophages.
 - Cyanobacterial groEL analogues.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae 65 Kd antigen, Coxiella burnetti heat
   shock protein B (gene htpB), Rickettsia tsutsugamushi major antigen 58, and
   Chlamydial 57 Kd hypersensitivity antigen  (gene hypB).
 - Chloroplast RuBisCO subunit  binding-protein  alpha  and beta chains, which
   bind ribulose  bisphosphate  carboxylase  small and large subunits  and are
   implicated in the assembly of the enzyme oligomer.
 - Mammalian mitochondrial matrix protein P1 (mitonin or P60).
 - Yeast HSP60 protein, a mitochondrial assembly factor.

As a  signature    pattern   for these proteins, we have chosen a  rather well
conserved region  of  twelve  residues, located in the last third of the cpn60
sequence.

* Chaperonins TCP-1 signatures *
********************************

The TCP-1 protein [1,2] (Tailless Complex Polypeptide 1)  was first identified
in mice  where  it  is especially  abundant  in testis but present in all cell
types. It has  since  been  found  and  characterized  in many other mammalian
species, in Drosophila and in yeast.  TCP-1  is  a highly conserved protein of
about 60  Kd  (556  to 560 residues) which participates in a hetero-oligomeric
900 Kd  double-torus shaped particle [3] with 6 to 8 other different subunits.
These subunits,  the  chaperonin  containing  TCP-1 (CCT) subunit beta, gamma,
delta, epsilon,  zeta  and eta are evolutionary related to TCP-1 itself [4,5].
The CCT  is  known  to  act  as  a  molecular chaperone for tubulin, actin and
probably some other proteins.

The CCT subunits are highly related to archebacterial counterparts:

 - TF55 and TF56 [6], a molecular chaperone from Sulfolobus shibatae. TF55 has
   ATPase activity,  is  known  to  bind  unfolded  polypeptides  and  forms a
   oligomeric complex of two stacked nine-membered rings.
 - Thermosome  [7],  from Thermoplasma acidophilum. The thermosome is composed
   of two  subunits  (alpha  and  beta)  and also seems to be a chaperone with
   ATPase activity. It forms an oligomeric complex of eight-membered rings.

The TCP-1 family of proteins are weakly, but significantly [8], related to the
cpn60/groEL chaperonin family (see <PDOC00268>).

As signature patterns of this family of chaperonins,  we chose three conserved
regions located in the N-terminal domain.

* Heat shock hsp20 proteins family profile *
********************************************

Prokaryotic   and  eukaryotic  organisms   respond  to  heat  shock  or  other
environmental stress  by inducing the synthesis of proteins collectively known
as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1]. Amongst them is a family of proteins with an
average molecular weight of 20 Kd, known as the hsp20 proteins [2 to 5]. These
seem to act as chaperones that can protect other proteins against heat-induced
denaturation and    aggregation.   Hsp20   proteins   seem   to   form   large
heterooligomeric aggregates;   their  family  is  currently  composed  of  the
following members:

 - Vertebrate  heat  shock  protein  hsp27  (hsp25),  induced  by a variety of
   environmental stresses.
 - Drosophila heat shock proteins hsp22, hsp23, hsp26, hsp27, hsp67BA and BC.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hsp16 multigene family.
 - Fungal  HSP26  (budding yeast) and hsp30 (Neurospora crassa and Aspergillus
   Nidulans).
 - Plant  small  hsp's.  Plants  have  four classes of hsp20: classes I and II
   which are  cytoplasmic, class III which is chloroplastic and class IV which
   is found in the endomembrane.
 - Alpha-crystallin   A   and   B  chains.  Alpha-crystallin  is  an  abundant
   constituent of the eye lens of most vertebrate species.  Its  main function
   appears to be to  maintain the correct refractive index of the lens.  It is
   also found in other tissues where it seems to act as a chaperone [6].
 - Schistosoma  mansoni  major  egg antigen p40. Structurally, p40 is built of
   two tandem hsp20 domains.
 - A  variety  of  prokaryotic proteins: ibpA and ibpB from  Escherichia coli,
   hsp18 from  Clostridium  acetobutylicum,  spore  protein  SP21  (hspA) from
   Stigmatella aurantiaca,    Mycobacterium   leprae   18   Kd   antigen   and
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis 14 Kd antigen.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0285.

Structurally, this family is characterized  by  the presence of a conserved C-
terminal domain of about 100 residues. The profile developed to detect members
of the hsp20 family is based on an alignment of this domain.

* Heat shock hsp70 proteins family signatures *
***********************************************

Prokaryotic   and  eukaryotic  organisms   respond  to  heat  shock  or  other
environmental  stress  by  the  induction   of   the  synthesis   of  proteins
collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1].  Amongst them is a family
of proteins  with  an  average   molecular weight of 70 Kd, known as the hsp70
proteins [2,3,4].  In most species, there are many proteins that belong to the
hsp70 family.  Some  of them are  expressed under unstressed conditions. Hsp70
proteins can  be found in different cellular compartments (nuclear, cytosolic,
mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.). Some of the hsp70 family proteins
are listed below:

 - In Escherichia coli and other bacteria, the main hsp70  protein is known as
   the dnaK  protein.  A  second  protein, hscA, has been recently discovered.
   dnaK is also found in the chloroplast genome of red algae.
 - In yeast, at least ten hsp70 proteins  are  known  to exist:  SSA1 to SSA4,
   SSB1, SSB2, SSC1, SSD1 (KAR2), SSE1 (MSI3) and SSE2.
 - In Drosophila, there are  at least eight  different  hsp70 proteins: HSP70,
   HSP68, and HSC-1 to HSC-6.
 - In  mammals,  there  are at least eight different proteins: HSPA1 to HSPA6,
   HSC70, and  GRP78  (also  known  as  the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding
   protein (BiP)).
 - In the sugar beet yellow virus (SBYV),  a hsp70  homolog has been shown [5]
   to exist.
 - In archaebacteria, hsp70 proteins are also present [6].

All proteins belonging to the hsp70 family bind ATP.   A variety  of functions
has  been postulated for  hsp70 proteins.  It now appears  [7] that some hsp70
proteins play an important role in the transport of proteins across membranes.
They also  seem    to  be    involved in protein  folding and in the assembly/
disassembly of protein complexes [8].

We have derived three signature patterns for the hsp70 family of proteins; the
first centered on a conserved  pentapeptide found in the N-terminal section of
these proteins;  the  two  others  on conserved regions located in the central
part of the sequence.

Prokaryotic   and  eukaryotic  organisms   respond  to  heat  shock  or  other
environmental  stress  by  the  induction   of   the  synthesis   of  proteins
collectively known as heat-shock proteins (hsp) [1].  Amongst them is a family
of proteins,  with  an  average  molecular weight of 90 Kd, known as the hsp90
proteins. Proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Escherichia coli and other bacteria heat shock protein c62.5 (gene htpG).
 - Vertebrate hsp 90-alpha (hsp 86) and hsp 90-beta (hsp 84).
 - Drosophila hsp 82 (hsp 83).
 - Trypanosoma cruzi hsp 85.
 - Plants Hsp82 or Hsp83.
 - Yeast and other fungi HSC82, and HSP82.
 - The endoplasmic reticulum  protein 'endoplasmin'  (also  known  as Erp99 in
   mouse, GRP94 in hamster, and hsp 108 in chicken).

The exact function of  hsp90  proteins is not yet known. In higher eukaryotes,
hsp90  has been found associated with steroid hormone receptors, with tyrosine
kinase oncogene  products of several retroviruses,  with eIF2alpha kinase, and
with actin  and  tubulin.  Hsp90  are probable chaperonins that possess ATPase
activity [2,3].

As a signature pattern for the  hsp90  family of  proteins, we have selected a
highly conserved region found in the N-terminal part of these proteins.

* Chaperonins clpA/B signatures *
*********************************

A number  of  ATP-binding  proteins that are are thought to protect cells from
extreme stress  by  controlling  the  aggregation  of  denaturation  of  vital
cellular structures  have  been  shown [1,2] to be evolutionary related. These
proteins are listed below.

 - Escherichia  coli  clpA,  which acts as the  regulatory subunit of the ATP-
   dependent protease clp.
 - Rhodopseudomonas blastica clpA homolog.
 - Escherichia coli heat shock protein clpB and homologs in other bacteria.
 - Bacillus subtilis protein mecB.
 - Yeast heat shock protein 104 (gene HSP104), which is vital for tolerance to
   heat, ethanol and other stresses.
 - Neurospora heat shock protein hsp98.
 - Yeast mitochondrial heat shock protein 78 (gene HSP78) [3].
 - CD4A  and CD4b, two highly related  tomato proteins that seem to be located
   in the chloroplast.
 - Trypanosoma brucei protein clp.
 - Porphyra purpurea chloroplast encoded clpC.

The size  of  these proteins range from 84 Kd (clpA) to slightly more than 100
Kd (HSP104).  They  all  share  two conserved regions of about 200 amino acids
that each contains an ATP-binding site. In addition  to  the ATP-binding A and
B motifs there are many parts in these two domains that are also conserved. We
have selected two of these regions as signature patterns.  The first signature
is located  in  the  first  domain, some ten residues to the C-terminal of the
ATP-binding B  motif.  The second  pattern is located in the second domain in-
between the ATP-binding A and B motifs.

The prokaryotic heat shock protein dnaJ  interacts  with  the chaperone hsp70-
like dnaK  protein  [1].  Structurally,  the  dnaJ  protein  consists of an N-
terminal conserved  domain  (called  'J'  domain)  of  about 70 amino acids, a
glycine-rich region  ('G'  domain')  of  about  30  residues, a central domain
containing four  repeats  of  a CXXCXGXG motif ('CRR' domain) and a C-terminal
region of  120  to  170  residues.  Such a structure is shown in the following
schematic representation:

  +------------+-+-------+-----+-----------+--------------------------------+
  | N-terminal | | Gly-R |     | CXXCXGXG  | C-terminal                     |
  +------------+-+-------+-----+-----------+--------------------------------+

It has been shown [2] that the 'J' domain as well as the 'CRR' domain are also
found in other prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins which are listed below.

a) Proteins containing both a 'J' and a 'CRR' domain:

 - Yeast protein MAS5/YDJ1 which seems to be involved in mitochondrial protein
   import.
 - Yeast  protein  MDJ1,  involved  in  mitochondrial  biogenesis  and protein
   folding.
 - Yeast protein SCJ1, involved in protein sorting.
 - Yeast protein XDJ1.
 - Plants dnaJ homologs (from leek and cucumber).
 - Human HDJ2, a dnaJ homolog of unknown function.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YNL077w.

b) Proteins containing a 'J' domain without a 'CRR' domain:

 - Rhizobium  fredii  nolC, a protein involved in cultivar-specific nodulation
   of soybean.
 - Escherichia coli cbpA [3], a protein that binds curved DNA.
 - Yeast  protein  SEC63/NPL1,  important  for  protein    assembly  into  the
   endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus.
 - Yeast protein SIS1, required for nuclear migration during mitosis.
 - Yeast protein CAJ1.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YFR041c.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YIR004w.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YJL162c.
 - Plasmodium falciparum  ring-infected  erythrocyte  surface  antigen (RESA).
   RESA, whose function is not known, is associated with the membrane skeleton
   of newly invaded erythrocytes.
 - Human HDJ1.
 - Human HSJ1, a neuronal protein.
 - Drosophila cysteine-string protein (csp).

We developed  a  signature  pattern  for  the  'J'  domain, based on conserved
positions in  the  C-terminal half of this domain. We also developed a pattern
for the  'CRR'  domain,  based  on the first two copies of that motif. We also
developed a profile for the 'J' domain.

* grpE protein signature *
**************************

In prokaryotes the grpE protein [1]  stimulates, jointly with dnaJ, the ATPase
activity of the dnaK chaperone. It seems to accelerate the release of ADP from
dnaK thus  allowing  dnaK  to  recycle  more efficiently. GrpE is a protein of
about 22 to 25 Kd.  In yeast, an  evolutionary  related  mitochondrial protein
(gene GRPE)  has  been  shown  [2]  to  associate with the mitochondrial hsp70
protein and to thus play a role in the import of proteins from the cytoplasm.

As a  signature  pattern, we selected the most conserved region of grpE. It is
located in the C-terminal section.

* Bacterial type II secretion system protein C signature *
**********************************************************

The secretion  pathway  (GSP) for the export of proteins (also called the type
II pathway)  [1] requires a number of protein components. One of them is known
as the  'C'  protein  and  has been sequenced in a variety of bacteria such as
Aeromonas (gene  exeC);  Erwinia  (gene  outC);  Escherichia coli (gene yheE);
Klebsiella pneumoniae  (gene  pulC);  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  (gene  xcpS) or
Vibrio cholerae (gene epsC).

The size  of  the  'C' protein is around 270 to 300 amino acids. It apparently
contains a single transmembrane domain located in the N-terminal section.  The
short N-terminal  domain  is  predicted  to  be  cytoplasmic  and the large C-
terminal domain  periplasmic.  As a signature pattern, we selected a conserved
region in the C-terminal part of these proteins.

 - The  gpIV  protein from filamentous phages such as f1, ike, or m13. GpIV is
   said to be involved in phage assembly and morphogenesis.

These proteins all seem to start with a signal  sequence and are thought to be

* Bacterial export FHIPEP family signature *
********************************************

A number  of  bacterial proteins seem to be involved in translocating specific
proteins across  the bacterial cell membrane by a distinct secretory mechanism
that does  not require the cleavage of a signal peptide. They are evolutionary
related and belong to a family [1,2,3] that currently consists of:

 - flhA  from  various  bacterial species, involved in the export of flagellar
   proteins.
 - hrpI   from   Erwinia   amylovora,   necessary   for  secreting  harpin,  a
   proteinaceous elecitor  of  the hypersensitive response (HR) in the host of
   this plant-pathogen.
 - hrpC2 from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, also involved in HR.
 - hrpI  from  Pseudomonas  syringae,  also involved in HR and probably in the
   secretion of harpin-Pss.
 - hrpO from Burkholderia solanacearum, also involved in HR.
 - invA from Salmonella typhimurium, which could be involved in  translocating
   the invE protein necessary for invading cells of the intestinal epithelium.
 - lcrD  from  Yersinia  enterocolitica and pestis, which could be involved in
   secreting the Yop virulence proteins.
 - mxiA  from Shigella flexneri, involved in secreting the Ipa invasins  which
   are necessary for penetration of intestinal epithelial cells.

These proteins have all about 700 amino-acid residues.  The N-terminal half is
highly conserved  and  seems  to  contain 6 to 8 transmembrane domains. The C-
terminal half  is  less  conserved  and  seemingly     devoid of transmembrane
domains. It  is  possible that these proteins serve as pores for the export of
specific proteins.  We call  this family FHIPEP, which stands for Flagella/Hr/
Invasion Proteins Export Pore.

As a  signature  pattern, we  selected  the  best  conserved  region: a highly
conserved hydrophilic domain between two transmembranes regions.

The eubacterial secA protein [1] plays an important role in protein export. It

system. It  has  a  central  role  in  coupling  the  hydrolysis of ATP to the
transfer of proteins across the membrane. SecA is a cytoplasmic protein of 800
to 960 amino acid residues.

Homologs of secA are also encoded in the chloroplast  genome of some algae [2]
as well  as  in  the nuclear genome of plants [3]. It could be involved in the
intraorganellar protein transport into thylakoids.

We have  developed  a  signature  pattern  for secA proteins based on the best

* Protein secY signatures *
***************************

The eubacterial secY protein [1] plays an important role in protein export. It
interacts with the signal sequences of  secretory proteins as well as with two
other  components of the protein translocation system: secA and secE.  SecY is
an integral  plasma membrane protein  of  419 to 492  amino acid residues that
apparently  contains ten  transmembrane  segments.  Such  a structure probably
confers to secY a 'translocator' function, providing a channel for periplasmic
and outer-membrane precursor proteins.

Homologs of  secY  are  found in archaebacteria [2].  SecY  is also encoded in
the chloroplast  genome  of  some algae [3]  where  it  could be involved in a
prokaryotic-like protein  export  system  across  the  two  membranes  of  the
chloroplast endoplasmic reticulum (CER) which  is  present in  chromophyte and
cryptophyte algae.

In eukaryotes,  the  evolutionary related protein sec61-alpha plays a role  in
protein translocation  through  the  endoplasmic  reticulum;  it  is part of a
trimeric complex that also consist of sec61-beta and gamma [4].

We have  developed  two   signature patterns  for  secY  proteins.  The  first
corresponds to   the second  transmembrane region, which is the most conserved
section of  these proteins. The second spans the C-terminal part of the fourth
transmembrane region,   a short intracellular loop, and the N-terminal part of
the fifth transmembrane region.

In bacteria, the secE protein plays a role in protein export; it is one of the

translocase. In eukaryotes, the evolutionary related protein sec61-gamma plays
a role  in protein translocation through the endoplasmic reticulum; it is part
of a trimeric complex that also consist of sec61-alpha and beta [1]. Both secE
and sec61-gamma  are small proteins of about 60 to 90 amino acids that contain
a single  transmembrane region at their C-terminal extremity (Escherichia coli
secE is  an exception,  in  that  it possess an extra N-terminal segment of 60
residues that contains two additional transmembrane domains).

The sequence  of  secE/sec61-gamma is not extremely well conserved, however it
is possible  to  derive  a  signature  pattern centered on a conserved proline
located 10 residues before the beginning of the transmembrane domain.

* Fimbrial biogenesis outer membrane usher protein signature *
**************************************************************

In Gram-negative bacteria the biogenesis of fimbriae (or pili) requires a two-
component assembly  and  transport  system  which is composed of a periplasmic
chaperone (see  <PDOC00552>)  and  an  outer  membrane  protein which has been
termed a  molecular  'usher'  [1,2,3]. The protein is rather large (from 86 to
100 Kd) and seems to be mainly composed  of  membrane-spanning  beta-sheets, a
structure reminiscent  of  porins.  Known  members  of  this family are listed
below:

 - Escherichia coli papC for P pili.
 - Escherichia coli afaC for AFA-III adhesin.
 - Escherichia coli aggC for AAF/I fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli cssD for CS6 antigen.
 - Escherichia coli faeD for K88 pili.
 - Escherichia coli fanD for K99 pili.
 - Escherichia coli fasD for 987P fimbria.
 - Escherichia coli fimD for type 1 fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli focD for F1C fimbriae.
 - Escherichia coli htrE for a yet unknown pilin.
 - Escherichia coli CS3-2 for CS3 pili.
 - Bordetella  pertussis  fhaA  (or  fimC)  for  filamentous hemagglutinin and
   fimbria.
 - Haemophilus influenzae hifC for type b pili.
 - Klebsiella pneumoniae mrkC for type 3 pili.
 - Proteus mirabilis pmfC for PMF fimbriae.
 - Salmonella enteritidis sefC for sef14 fimbriae.
 - Salmonella typhimurium lpfC for long polar fimbriae.
 - Yersinia enterocolitica myfC for myf fimbriae.
 - Yersinia pestis caf1A for F1 capsule antigen.

 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ycbS.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yehB.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yfcU.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yhcD.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yqiG.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yraJ.

The degree of sequence similarity of these proteins is not very high.  However
they  share a number of characteristics. One them is the presence of two pairs
of cysteines, the first one  is  located in the N-terminal part and the second
at the  C-terminal  extremity.  They are probably involved in disulfide bonds.
The best conserved region is located in the central part of these proteins and
can be used as a signature pattern.

* SRP54-type proteins GTP-binding domain signature *
****************************************************

The signal recognition particle (SRP) is  an oligomeric  complex that mediates
targeting  and  insertion of  the signal  sequence of  exported  proteins into
the membrane  of the  endoplasmic reticulum.  SRP consists of a 7S RNA and six
protein subunits.  One of these subunits, the 54 Kd protein (SRP54), is a GTP-
binding protein that interacts with the signal sequence  when  it emerges from
the ribosome.  The  N-terminal 300  residues of  SRP54 include the GTP-binding
site (G-domain)    and  are  evolutionary  related to similar domains in other
proteins which are listed below [1].

 - Escherichia  coli and Bacillus subtilis ffh  protein (P48), a protein which
   seems to be the prokaryotic counterpart of SRP54.  Ffh is associated with a
   4.5S RNA in the prokaryotic SRP complex.
 - Signal recognition particle  receptor  alpha  subunit (docking protein), an
   integral membrane GTP-binding protein which ensures,  in  conjunction  with
   SRP, the correct targeting of nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic
   reticulum membrane.  The G-domain is located at the C-terminal extremity of
   the protein.
 - Bacterial  ftsY protein, a protein which is believed to play a similar role
   to that  of  the  docking protein in eukaryotes. The G-domain is located at
   the C-terminal extremity of the protein.
 - The pilA protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae  which  seems to be the homolog
   of ftsY.
 - A protein from the archaebacteria Sulfolobus solfataricus. This protein  is
   also believed  to  be  a  docking  protein.  The G-domain is also at the C-
   terminus.
 - Bacterial flagellar biosynthesis protein flhF.

The best conserved  regions in  those domains are the sequence motifs that are
part of the GTP-binding site, but as those regions are not specific  to  these
proteins, we did not use them as a signature pattern.   Instead, we selected a
conserved region located at the C-terminal end of the domain.

* Cyclin-dependent kinases regulatory subunits signatures *
***********************************************************

Cyclin-dependent kinases  (CDK)  are  protein  kinases  which  associate  with
cyclins to  regulate  eukaryotic  cell cycle progression.  The most well known
CDK is p34-cdc2 (CDC28 in yeast) which is required  for entry into S-phase and
mitosis. CDK's  bind  to  a  regulatory  subunit  which is essential for their
biological function.  This regulatory  subunit is a small protein of 79 to 150
residues. In  yeast  (gene  CKS1)  and  in  fission yeast (gene suc1) a single
isoform is known, while mammals have two highly related isoforms.

It has  been  shown  [1]  that  these  CDK regulatory subunits  assemble as an
hexamer which  then acts as a hub for the oligomerization of six CDK catalytic
subunits.

The sequence  of  CDK regulatory subunits are highly conserved and we used the
two most conserved regions as signature patterns.

* Pentaxin family signature *
*****************************

Pentaxins (or pentraxins) [1,2] are a  family  of  proteins  which show, under
electron  microscopy,  a  discoid  arrangement  of  five  noncovalently  bound
subunits. Proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein which, in  mammals, is expressed during
   acute phase response to tissue injury or inflammation. CRP displays several
   functions  associated  with   host  defense:  it  promotes   agglutination,
   bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis  and complement  fixation through
   its calcium-dependent binding  to phosphorylcholine.   CRPs  have also been
   sequenced in an invertebrate, the Atlantic horseshoe crab, where they are a
   normal constituent of the hemolymph.
 - Serum Amyloid P-component (SAP), a precursor of amyloid  component P  which
   is found in basement membrane and is associated with amyloid deposits.
 - Hamster  female  protein  (FP),  a  plasma  protein  whose concentration is
   altered by sex steroids and stimuli that elicit an acute phase response.

A number of proteins, whose  function is  not yet clear,  contain a C-terminal
pentaxin-like domain. These proteins are:

 - Human PTX3 (or TSG-14). PTX3 is a cytokine-induced protein.
 - Guinea  pig  apexin  [3], a sperm acrosomal protein. Apexin seems to be the
   ortholog of human neuronal pentraxin II (gene NPTX2) [4].
 - Rat neuronal pentaxin I [5].

The sequences of the different members of this family are quite conserved.  As
a signature,  we  selected  a six residue pattern  which  includes a  cysteine
known to be involved in a disulfide bridge in CRPs and SAP.

The basic structure  of immunoglobulin (Ig) [1] molecules is a tetramer of two
light chains  and two heavy chains linked  by disulfide  bonds.  There are two
types of  light chains:  kappa and lambda,  each composed of a constant domain
(CL) and a variable domain (VL).  There are five types of heavy chains: alpha,
delta, epsilon,  gamma  and  mu,  all consisting of a variable domain (VH) and
three (in alpha,  delta  and  gamma)  or  four (in  epsilon and  mu)  constant
domains (CH1 to CH4).

The major histocompatibility complex  (MHC) molecules  are made of two chains.
In class I [2] the alpha  chain is composed of three  extracellular domains, a
transmembrane   region   and a   cytoplasmic tail.   The  beta  chain (beta-2-
microglobulin) is  composed of a single extracellular domain. In class II [3],
both the  alpha and the beta chains are composed of two extracellular domains,
a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail.

It is  known  [4,5]    that  the  Ig  constant  chain  domains  and   a single
extracellular   domain   in each  type  of  MHC   chains are related.    These
homologous domains  are  approximately    one    hundred amino  acids long and

* Prion protein signatures *
****************************

Prion protein (PrP) [1,2,3] is a  small glycoprotein found in high quantity in
the brains of  humans  or animals  infected  with  a  number  of  degenerative
neurological diseases such as  Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD),  scrapie
or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).   PrP is encoded in the host genome
and expressed  both  in  normal  and  infected  cells.  It  has  a tendency to
aggregate yielding polymers called rods.

Structurally, PrP is  a  protein consisting  of  a signal peptide, followed by
an N-terminal  domain  that contains tandem repeats of a short motif (PHGGGWGQ
in mammals, PHNPGY in chicken), itself followed  by  a highly conserved domain
of about  140  residues  that  contains a  disulfide bond.  Finally comes a C-
terminal hydrophobic domain post-translationally  removed when PrP is attached
to the extracellular side of the cell membrane by a GPI-anchor.  The structure
of PrP is shown in the following schematic representation:

 +---+----------------+-******-------------------****-----+-----+
 |Sig| Tandem repeats |                    C        C    S|     |

* Cyclins signature *

Cyclins [1,2,3]  are  eukaryotic   proteins  which  play  an  active  role  in
controlling  nuclear  cell  division cycles.  Cyclins, together  with  the p34
(cdc2)  or cdk2 kinases, form the Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF). There are
two main groups of cyclins:

 - G2/M  cyclins,  essential  for  the  control of the  cell cycle at the G2/M
   (mitosis) transition.   G2/M cyclins  accumulate steadily during G2 and are
   abruptly destroyed as cells exit from mitosis (at the end of the M-phase).
 - G1/S  cyclins,  essential  for  the   control of the cell cycle at the G1/S
   (start) transition.

In most species, there are multiple  forms of  G1 and G2 cyclins. For example,
in vertebrates,  there  are  two G2 cyclins, A and B,  and  at least  three G1
cyclins, C, D, and E.

A cyclin homolog has also been found in herpesvirus saimiri [4].

The best conserved region is in the central  part  of  the cyclins' sequences,
known as the 'cyclin-box', from which we have derived a 32 residue pattern.

Proliferating cell  nuclear  antigen (PCNA) [1,2] is a protein involved in DNA
replication  by  acting  as a    cofactor    for    DNA  polymerase delta, the
polymerase responsible for leading strand DNA replication.

A similar protein exists  in  yeast (gene POL30) [3]  and is  associated  with
polymerase III, the yeast analog of polymerase delta.   In  baculoviruses  the
ETL protein has  been shown [4] to  be highly related  to PCNA and is probably
associated with the viral encoded DNA polymerase. An homolog  of  PCNA is also
found in archebacteria.

As signatures for this family of proteins, we selected a two conserved regions
located in  the  N-terminal  section. The second one has been proposed to bind
DNA.

Actin-depolymerizing proteins  sever  actin filaments (F-actin) and/or bind to
actin monomers,   or   G-actin,   thus   preventing   actin-polymerization  by
sequestering the    monomers.  The following proteins are evolutionary related
and belong  to  a  family of low molecular weight (137 to 166 residues) actin-
depolymerizing proteins [1,2,3,4]:

 - Cofilin  from  vertebrates,  slime mold and yeast. Cofilin binds to F-actin
   and acts as a pH-dependent actin-depolymerizing protein.
 - Destrin  from  vertebrates.  Destrin  binds  to G-actin in a pH-independent
   manner and prevents polymerization.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans unc-60.
 - Acanthamoeba castellanii actophorin.
 - Plants actin depolymerizing factor (ADF).

The most  conserved  region  of  these proteins is a twenty amino-acid segment
that ends some  30  residues from their C-terminal extremity. This segment has
been shown [5] to be important for actin-binding.

* Apoptosis regulator proteins, Bcl-2 family BH domains signatures/profiles *

Active cell  suicide  (apoptosis)  is  induced by events such as growth factor
withdrawal and  toxins.  It  is controlled by regulators, which have either an
inhibitory effect    on    programmed cell death (anti-apoptotic) or block the
protective effect of inhibitors (pro-apoptotic) [1,2]. Many viruses have found
a way of countering defensive  apoptosis  by encoding their own anti-apoptosis
genes preventing their target-cells from dying too soon.

All proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family [3] contain either a BH1, BH2, BH3,
or BH4  domain.  All anti-apoptotic proteins contain BH1 and BH2 domains; some
of them  contain an additional N-terminal BH4 domain (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bcl-w),
which is  never  seen  in  pro-apoptotic proteins, except for Bcl-x(S). On the
other hand,  all  pro-apoptotic proteins contain a BH3 domain (except for Bad)
necessary for dimerization with other proteins of Bcl-2 family and crucial for
their killing  activity;  some  of them also contain BH1 and BH2 domains (Bax,
Bak). The  BH3  domain is also present in some anti-apoptotic protein, such as
Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L).

Proteins that are known to contain these domains are listed below.

 - Vertebrate protein  Bcl-2. Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis; it prolongs the survival
   of hematopoietic  cells  in the absence of required growth factors and also
   in the presence of various stimuli inducing cellular death. Two isoforms of
   bcl-2 (alpha  and  beta)  are generated by alternative  splicing.  Bcl-2 is
   expressed in  a  wide range of tissues at various times during development.
   It forms heterodimers with the Bax proteins.
 - Vertebrate protein Bcl-x. Two isoforms of Bcl-x (Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-x(S)) are
   generated by  alternative splicing. While the longer product (Bcl-x(L)) can
   protect a  growth-factor-dependent  cell  line  from apoptosis, the shorter
   form blocks  the  protective  effect  of  Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) and acts as an
   anti-anti-apoptosis protein.
 - Mammalian  protein  Bax. Bax block the anti-apoptosis ability of Bcl-2 with
   which it forms heterodimers. There is no evidence that Bax has any activity
   in the absence of Bcl-2. Three isoforms of bax (alpha, beta and gamma)  are
   generated by alternative splicing.
 - Mammalian  protein  Bak,  which  promotes  cell  death  and counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Mammalian protein Bcl-w, which promotes cell survival.
 - Mammalian  protein  bad,  which  promotes  cell  death, and counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-x(L), but not that of Bcl-2.
 - Human  protein  Bik,  which promotes cell death, but cannot counteracts the
   protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Mouse  protein  Bid,  which induces caspases and apoptosis, and counteracts
   the protection from apoptosis provided by Bcl-2.
 - Xenopus laevis protein Xr1, which could be the homolog of mammalian Bcl-w.
 - Xenopus laevis protein Xr11, which promotes cell survival.
 - Human  induced  myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL1. MCL1 is
   probably involved   in   programming  of  differentiation  and  concomitant
   maintenance of  viability  but  not proliferation. Its expression increases
   early during  phorbolester induced differentiation in myeloid leukemia cell
   line ML-1.
 - Mouse hemopoietic-specific early response protein A1.
 - African swine fever virus protein LMW5-HL, a bcl-2  homolog expressed early
   and late  in  the infection cycle. It also shows similarity to the Epstein-
   Barr-Virus (EBV)  BHRF1, which is distantly related to the Bcl-2 family and
   is therefore not discussed in this entry.
 - Caenorhabditis protein ced-9 [2].
 - Mammalian activator of apoptosis Harakiri [4] (also known as neuronal death
   protein Dp5).  This  is  a  small  protein  of  92  residues that activates
   apoptosis. It contains a BH3 domain, but no BH1, BH2 or BH4 domains.

We have  developed  patterns  for the four BH domains. There is also a profile
for the BH4 domain as

* Arrestins signature *
***********************

Arrestin (or S-antigen) [1] is a protein  that interacts  with light-activated
phosphorylated  rhodopsin  thereby  inhibiting  or 'arresting'  its ability to
interact with transducin.   In mammals, arrestin is associated with autoimmune
uveitis.

Arrestin belongs to a family of closely related proteins including:

 - Beta-arrestin-1  and  -2,  proteins  that  regulate  the  function of beta-
   adrenergic receptors.  They  bind  to the phosphorylated form of the latter
   thereby causing a significant impairment of their capacity to activate G(S)
   proteins.
 - Cone  photoreceptors  C-arrestin  (arrestin-X)  [2],  which  could  bind to
   phosphorylated red/green opsins.
 - Phosrestins  I  and  II from Drosophila and related insects. These proteins
   undergo light-induced   phosphorylation  and  play  an  important  role  in
   photoreceptor transduction.

Sequence comparison of proteins from the arrestin family shows a high level of
conservation. As  a  signature pattern, we selected a region located in the N-
terminal section that contains many charged and hydrophobic residues.

********************************
* AAA-protein family signature *
********************************

A large family of ATPases has been described [1 to 5,E1] whose  key feature is
that they share  a  conserved region of about 220 amino acids that contains an
ATP-binding site.  This  family  is now called AAA, for 'A'TPases 'A'ssociated
with diverse  cellular   'A'ctivities. The proteins that belong to this family
either contain one or two AAA domains.

Proteins containing two AAA domains:

 - Mammalian  and  drosophila  NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)
   and the fungal homolog, SEC18. These proteins are involved in intracellular
   transport between the  endoplasmic reticulum  and Golgi, as well as between
   different Golgi cisternae.
 - Mammalian  transitional  endoplasmic  reticulum ATPase (previously known as
   p97 or  VCP)  which  is  involved  in  the  transfer  of membranes from the
   endoplasmic reticulum  to  the  golgi apparatus. This protein forms a ring-
   shaped homooligomer  composed  of  six subunits. The yeast homolog is CDC48
   and it may play a role in spindle pole proliferation.
 - Yeast  protein  PAS1,  essential  for  peroxisome  assembly and the related
   protein PAS1 from Pichia pastoris.
 - Yeast protein AFG2.
 - Sulfolobus  acidocaldarius  protein  SAV  and Halobacterium salinarium cdcH
   which may  be  part  of  a  transduction  pathway  connecting light to cell
   division.

Proteins containing a single AAA domain:

 - Escherichia    coli  and  other bacteria ftsH (or hflB) protein. FtsH is an
   ATP-dependent zinc metallopeptidase that seems  to  degrade  the heat-shock
   sigma-32 factor.   It   is  an  integral  membrane  protein  with  a  large
   cytoplasmic C-terminal  domain  that  contain both the AAA and the protease
   domains.
 - Yeast protein YME1, a protein  important  for  maintaining the integrity of
   the mitochondrial compartment. YME1 is also a zinc-dependent protease.
 - Yeast  protein  AFG3  (or  YTA10). This protein also seems to contain a AAA
   domain followed by a zinc-dependent protease domain.
 - Subunits  from  the  regulatory  complex of the 26S proteasome [6] which is
   involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins:
   a) Mammalian  subunit  4  and homologs in other higher eukaryotes, in yeast
      (gene YTA5) and fission yeast (gene mts2).
   b) Mammalian  subunit  6 (TBP7) and homologs in other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (gene YTA2).
   c) Mammalian subunit 7 (MSS1)  and  homologs in other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (gene CIM5 or YTA3).
   d) Mammalian subunit 8 (P45)  and  homologs in  other higher eukaryotes and
      in yeast (SUG1 or CIM3 or TBY1) and fission yeast (gene let1).
   d) Other probable subunits such as human TBP1 which seems to influences HIV
      gene expression by interacting with the virus tat transactivator protein
      and yeast YTA1 and YTA6.
 - Yeast protein BCS1, a mitochondrial protein essential for the expression of
   the Rieske iron-sulfur protein.
 - Yeast protein MSP1, a protein  involved  in  intramitochondrial  sorting of
   proteins.
 - Yeast  protein  PAS8,  and  the  corresponding  proteins  PAS5  from Pichia
   pastoris and PAY4 from Yarrowia lipolytica.
 - Mouse protein SKD1 and its fission yeast homolog (SpAC2G11.06).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans meiotic spindle formation protein mei-1.
 - Yeast protein SAP1.
 - Yeast protein YTA7.
 - Mycobacterium leprae hypothetical protein A2126A.

It is proposed that, in general, the AAA domains in these proteins act as ATP-
dependent protein clamps [5].

In addition  to  the  ATP-binding 'A' and 'B'  motifs  (see the relevant entry
<PDOC00017>), which  are  located in the N-terminal half of this domain, there
is a highly conserved region located in the central part of the  domain  which
we have used to develop a signature pattern.

-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL,  except
 for 3 sequences.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.

-Note: this pattern will  only  detect  the  first domain of SEC18/NSF and the
 second domain  of  PAS1.  The  other  domain  in  these proteins is much less
 conserved outside of the ATP-binding region.

******************************************
* Ubiquitin domain signature and profile *
******************************************

Ubiquitin [1,2,3] is a protein  of  seventy  six amino acid residues, found in
all eukaryotic  cells  and  whose  sequence   is extremely well conserved from
protozoan to  vertebrates.  It  plays  a  key  role  in  a variety of cellular
processes, such as ATP-dependent  selective  degradation of cellular proteins,
maintenance of  chromatin  structure,  regulation  of  gene expression, stress
response and ribosome biogenesis.

In most  species,  there are many genes coding for ubiquitin. However they can
be classified  into  two  classes.  The  first  class  produces  polyubiquitin
molecules consisting of exact head to tail repeats of ubiquitin. The number of
repeats  is  variable (up  to  twelve in a Xenopus gene).  In  the majority of
polyubiquitin precursors, there is a  final amino-acid  after the last repeat.
The second  class  of genes produces precursor proteins consisting of a single
copy of ubiquitin fused to a C-terminal extension protein (CEP). There are two
types of CEP proteins and both seem to be ribosomal proteins.

Ubiquitin is a globular protein, the  last  four C-terminal residues (Leu-Arg-
Gly-Gly) extending  from the compact structure to form a 'tail', important for
its function.  The latter is mediated by the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin
to target  proteins,  by  an isopeptide linkage between the C-terminal glycine
and the epsilon amino group of lysine residues in the target proteins.

There are a number of proteins which are evolutionary related to ubiquitin:

 - Ubiquitin-like  proteins from  baculoviruses as well as in  some strains of
   bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV).  These proteins are highly similar to
   their eukaryotic counterparts.
 - Mammalian  protein  GDX [4].  GDX is composed  of two domains, a N-terminal
   ubiquitin-like domain of 74 residues and a C-terminal domain of 83 residues
   with some similarity with the thyroglobulin hormonogenic site.
 - Mammalian  protein  FAU  [5].   FAU is a  fusion protein which consist of a
   N-terminal ubiquitin-like protein of 74 residues fused to ribosomal protein
   S30.
 - Mouse protein NEDD-8 [6], a ubiquitin-like protein of 81 residues.
 - Human protein BAT3, a large fusion protein of 1132 residues that contains a
   N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein ubl-1 [7].  Ubl-1 is a  fusion protein which
   consist of  a  N-terminal  ubiquitin-like  protein  of 70 residues fused to
   ribosomal protein S27A.
 - Yeast DNA repair protein RAD23 [8]. RAD23 contains a N-terminal domain that
   seems to be distantly, yet significantly, related to ubiquitin.
 - Mammalian RAD23-related proteins RAD23A and RAD23B.
 - Mammalian  BCL-2  binding  athanogene-1  (BAG-1). BAG-1 is a protein of 274
   residues that contains a central ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Human spliceosome associated protein 114 (SAP 114 or SF3A120).
 - Yeast protein DSK2, a protein involved in spindle pole body duplication and
   which contains a N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain.
 - Human  protein  CKAP1/TFCB,  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  protein  alp11 and
   Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F53F4.3. These proteins contain
   a N-terminal   ubiquitin  domain  and  a  C-terminal  CAP-Gly  domain  (see
   <PDOC00660>).
 - Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  hypothetical  protein SpAC26A3.16. This protein
   contains a N-terminal ubiquitin domain.

 - Yeast protein SMT3.
 - Human ubiquitin-like proteins SMT3A and SMT3B.
 - Human ubiquitin-like protein SMT3C (also known as PIC1; Ubl1, Sumo-1; Gmp-1
   or Sentrin).  This  protein is involved in targeting ranGAP1 to the nuclear
   pore complex protein ranBP2.
 - SMT3-like proteins in plants and Caenorhabditis elegans.

To identify ubiquitin and related proteins  we  have developed a pattern based
on conserved  positions  in the central section of the sequence. A profile was
also developed that spans the complete length of the ubiquitin domain.

-Consensus pattern: K-x(2)-[LIVM]-x-[DESAK]-x(3)-[LIVM]-[PA]-x(3)-Q-x-[LIVM]-

ADP-ribosylation factors  (ARF)  [1,2,3,4]  are  20  Kd  GTP-binding  proteins
involved in  protein  trafficking.  They  may  modulate  vesicle  budding  and
uncoating within  the Golgi apparatus. ARF's also act as allosteric activators
of cholera   toxin  ADP-ribosyltransferase  activity.  They  are  evolutionary
conserved and present in all eukaryotes. At least six forms of ARF are present
in mammals  and  three in budding yeast. The ARF family also includes proteins
highly related  to  ARF's  but which lack the cholera toxin cofactor activity,
they are collectively known as ARL's (ARF-like).

ARD1 is a 64 Kd mammalian protein of unknown biological function that contains
an ARF domain at its C-terminal extremity.

Proteins from  the ARF family  are generally included in the RAS 'superfamily'
of small  GTP-binding  proteins [5], but they are only slightly related to the
other RAS  proteins.  They  also  differ  from  RAS proteins in that they lack
cysteine residues  at  their    C-termini  and  are  therefore  not subject to
prenylation. The  ARFs  are  N-terminally myristoylated (the ARLs have not yet
been shown to be modified in such a fashion).

As a signature  pattern, we selected a conserved region in the C-terminal part
of ARF's and ARL's.

Ran (or  TC4)  is  a  small abundant nuclear protein that binds and hydrolyzes
GTP and  which  has  been implicated in a large number of processes  including

cycle checkpoint control [1,2].

Ran is  generally  included  in  the  RAS  'superfamily'  of small GTP-binding

acidic C-terminus. It is, however similar to RAS family members in requiring a
specific guanine  nucleotide  exchange  factor  (GEF)  and  a  specific GTPase
activating protein (GAP) as stimulators of overall GTPase activity.

As a  signature  pattern  we  selected  the  region of the GTP-binding B motif

* Band 7 protein family signature *
***********************************

Mammalian band  7  protein [1] (also known as 7.2B or stomatin) is an integral
membrane phosphoprotein   of  red  blood  cells  thought  to  regulate  cation
conductance by  interacting  with  other proteins of the junctional complex of
the membrane  skeleton.  Structurally, band  7  is evolutionary related to the
following proteins:

 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  protein  mec-2 [2]. Mec-2 positively regulates the
   activity of  the putative mechanosensory transduction channel. It may links
   the mechanosensory  channel  and  the microtubule cytoskeleton of the touch
   receptor neurons.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans proteins sto-1 to sto-4.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-1.
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybbK.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis hypothetical protein MtCY277.09.
 - Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 hypothetical protein slr1128.
 - Methanococcus jannaschii hypothetical protein MJ0827.

Structurally all  these  proteins  consist  of a short N-terminal domain which
is followed  by  a  transmembrane  region and a variable size (from 170 to 350
residues) C-terminal domain.

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  conserved region located about 110
residues after the transmembrane domain.

* Trp-Asp (WD-40) repeats signature and profiles *
**************************************************

Beta-transducin (G-beta) is one of the three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma)
of  the  guanine   nucleotide-binding  proteins  (G proteins)   which  act  as
intermediaries  in  the  transduction  of  signals  generated by transmembrane
receptors [1]. The alpha subunit binds to and hydrolyzes GTP; the functions of
the beta and gamma subunits  are less clear but  they  seem to be required for
the  replacement  of  GDP  by  GTP as  well  as  for  membrane  anchoring  and
receptor recognition.

In higher eukaryotes G-beta  exists  as  a  small multigene family  of  highly
conserved  proteins  of  about  340  amino acid residues.  Structurally G-beta
consists of eight  tandem  repeats  of  about  40  residues, each containing a
central Trp-Asp  motif  (this  type  of  repeat  is  sometimes  called a WD-40
repeat). Such  a  repetitive segment has been shown [E1,2,3,4,5] to exist in a
number of other proteins listed below:

 - Yeast STE4, a component of the pheromone response pathway. STE4 is a G-beta
   like protein that associates with GPA1 (G-alpha) and STE18 (G-gamma).
 - Yeast MSI1, a negative  regulator  of RAS-mediated cAMP synthesis.  MSI1 is
   most probably also a G-beta protein.

 - Human and chicken protein 12.3.  The function of this protein is not known,
   but on the basis of its similarity to G-beta proteins, it may also function
   in signal transduction.
 - Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii  gblp. This protein is most probably the homolog
   of vertebrate protein 12.3.
 - Human LIS1, a neuronal protein involved in type-1 lissencephaly [E2].
 - Mammalian  coatomer  beta'  subunit (beta'-COP), a component of a cytosolic
   protein complex  that  reversibly  associates  with Golgi membranes to form
   vesicles that mediate biosynthetic protein transport.

 - Yeast CDC4, essential for  initiation of DNA replication  and separation of
   the spindle pole bodies to form the poles of the mitotic spindle.
 - Yeast CDC20, a protein required  for  two  microtubule-dependent processes:
   nuclear movements prior to anaphase and chromosome separation.
 - Yeast MAK11, essential for  cell  growth  and  for  the  replication  of M1
   double-stranded RNA.
 - Yeast PRP4, a component of the U4/U6  small nuclear  ribonucleoprotein with
   a probable role in mRNA splicing.
 - Yeast PWP1, a protein of unknown function.
 - Yeast SKI8, a protein essential for controlling  the propagation of double-
   stranded RNA.
 - Yeast SOF1,  a  protein   required  for   ribosomal  RNA  processing  which
   associates with U3 small nucleolar RNA.
 - Yeast TUP1 (also known as AER2 or SFL2 or CYC9), a  protein  which has been
   implicated in    dTMP uptake,  catabolite repression, mating sterility, and
   many other phenotypes.
 - Yeast YCR57c, an ORF of unknown function from chromosome III.
 - Yeast YCR72c, an ORF of unknown function from chromosome III.

 - Slime mold coronin, an actin-binding protein.
 - Slime mold AAC3, a developmentally regulated protein of unknown function.

 - Drosophila protein Groucho (formerly known as E(spl); 'enhancer of split'),
   a protein  involved  in  neurogenesis  and  that seems to interact with the
   Notch and Delta proteins.
 - Drosophila TAF-II-80, a protein that is tightly associated with TFIID.

The number of repeats in the above  proteins varies between 5 (PRP4, TUP1, and
Groucho) and 8 (G-beta, STE4, MSI1, AAC3, CDC4, PWP1, etc.).  In G-beta and G-
beta like  proteins, the repeats span the entire length of the sequence, while
in other proteins,  they make up the N-terminal, the central or the C-terminal
section.

A signature pattern  can  be  developed  from  the  central core of the domain
(positions 9 to 23).

Two profiles were developed for this module, the first one picks up WD repeats
while  the  second  profile  is  'circular'  and  will  thus  detect  a region
containing adjacent WD repeats.

12 different isoforms of gamma subunits.

The Caenorhabditis  elegans  protein egl-10, which is a regulator of G-protein

********************************************************
* Ras GTPase-activating proteins signature and profile *
********************************************************

Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that  bind GTP and GDP
and slowly hydrolyze GTP to GDP [1].  This intrinsic GTPase activity of ras is
stimulated by a family of proteins  collectively  known  as  'GAP'  or GTPase-
activating proteins [2,3]. As it is the GTP bound form of ras which is active,
these proteins    are  said  to  be  down-regulators of ras. Proteins known to
possess such activity are listed below:

 - Mammalian GAP (p120GAP). GAP can down-regulate wild-type ras, but  fails to
   do so with oncogenic, mutated ras.
 - IRA1 and IRA2, the functional equivalents of  GAP in yeast.  They  regulate
   the RAS-cyclic AMP pathway, controlling cell growth.
 - sar1, the fission yeast protein that regulates ras1 in that organism.
 - BUD2/CLA2,  a yeast protein that activates BUD1/RSR1 and which participates
   in the regulation of bud-site selection [4].
 - Neurofibromin  (gene  NF1)  [5].  In  Man,  NF1  is  associated with type 1
   neurofibromatosis, one  of the  most  frequently inherited genetic diseases
   characterized, in  part,  by multiple neural tumors.  NF1  has  been  shown
   genetically and biochemically  to  interact with  and  stimulate the GTPase
   activity of h-ras.
 - Drosophila  Gap1  [6],  which acts as a negative regulator of signalling by
   the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase involved in eye development.
 - Mammalian Gap1m [7], which is related to the drosophila Gap1 protein.
 - Human  IQGAP1  [8],  a  sar1-related  protein  that  also contains putative
   calmodulin binding sites.

All the above proteins are quite large  (from  765  residues  for sar1 to 3079
residues for IRA2)  but  share  only  a limited (about 250 residues) region of
sequence similarity,  referred  to as the 'catalytic domain' or rasGAP domain.
The most conserved region within this domain contains a 15 residue motif which
seems to  be  characteristic  of this family of proteins [2]. A more sensitive
detection of the rasGAP domain is available through the use of a profile which
spans the whole conserved region.

Ras proteins are membrane-associated molecular switches that  bind GTP and GDP
and  slowly  hydrolyze  GTP to GDP [1].  The  balance  between  the  GTP bound
(active) and GDP bound (inactive) states  is regulated  by the opposite action
of proteins activating the GTPase activity and that of  proteins which promote
the loss of bound GDP and the uptake of fresh GTP [2,3].  The latter  proteins
are known  as  guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulators (GDSs)  (or also as
guanine-nucleotide releasing (or exchange) factors (GRFs)).  Proteins that act
as GDS can be classified  into at least two families, on the basis of sequence
similarities.  One of  these families is currently known to group the proteins
listed below   (references   are   only    provided  for  recently  determined
sequences):

 - CDC24 from yeast. CDC24 is a GDS that acts on the ras-like protein CDC42.
 - Dbl (or mcf-2) oncogene from mammals.  Dbl is a GDS for a  ras-like protein
   known as G25K or CDC42Hs.
 - p140-RAS GRF (cdc25Mm) from mammals. This protein, a GDS for ras, possesses
   both a domain belonging to the CDC24 family  and one belonging to the CDC25
   family.
 - Bcr oncogene from mammals. Bcr can form a chimera  with the abl protein and
   then cause   chronic  myelogenous  leukemia  (CML).  Bcr  acts  on  p21-rac
   proteins.
 - Abr, a protein highly similar to Bcr.
 - T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis inducing protein 1 (Tiam1 protein). Acts
   as a GDS for rac1, CDC42, and to a lesser extent rhoA.
 - Oncogenes vav and vav2 from mammals.  The target  of these proteins are not
   yet known.
 - Oncogene ect2 from mouse [4]. The target of this protein is not yet known.
 - scd1 from fission yeast.

The size of  these  proteins range from 736 residues (CDC42)  to 1591 residues
(Tiam1). The  sequence similarity shared by all these proteins is limited to a
region of  about  180  amino  acids,  generally located in their N-terminal or
central section.  As  a signature pattern, we selected the most conserved part
of this domain.

****************************
* MARCKS family signatures *
****************************

The myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) [1] is a protein of
about 300  amino  acid  residues  .  It  is one of the most prominent cellular
substrate for protein kinase C (PKC). The N-terminal glycine residue of MARCKS
is myristoylated  and  allows the protein  to associate with plasma membranes.
MARCKS binds calmodulin in a  calcium-dependent manner;  the  region of MARCKS
responsible for  calcium-binding    is a highly basic domain of 25 amino acids
(called PSD)  that  contains  the  PKC  phosphorylation  sites. When it is not
phosphorylated, the PSD domain can bind to filamentous actin.

A protein  known  as  MRP (MARCKS-related protein), MacMARKCS or F52 is highly
similar  to MARCKS both  in  its  properties (myristoylation, phosphorylation,
calmodulin-binding) and at the level of the sequence.

We have selected two signature patterns  for this family of protein. The first
is a  perfectly  conserved  heptapeptide  located  in  the  N-terminal part of
MARCKS and  MRP  and    also  found  in  the cytoplasmic region of the cation-
independent mannose-6-phosphate    receptor.  The function  of  this conserved
region is not yet known. The second pattern corresponds to the PSD domain.

* Stathmin family signatures *
******************************

Stathmin [1] (from the Greek 'stathmos' which means relay),  is an  ubiquitous
intracellular protein, present in a variety  of phosphorylated forms and which
serves  as a relay for diverse second  messenger pathways.  Its expression and
phosphorylation  are  regulated  throughout  development  and in  response  to
extracellular  signals  regulating  cell  proliferation,  differentiation  and
function.

Stathmin  is  a  highly   conserved  protein  of  149  amino  acid   residues.
Structurally, it  consists  of  an  N-terminal  domain  of  about  45 residues
followed by  a  78  residue alpha-helical domain consisting of a heptad repeat
coiled coil structure and a C-terminal domain of 25 residues.

Stathmin belongs to a family that also includes:

 - Protein  SCG10;   a   neuron-specific,   membrane-associated  protein  that
   accumulates in the growth cones of developing neurons. It is highly similar
   in its sequence to stathmin, but differs in that it contains an  additional
   N-terminal hydrophobic segment of 32 residues which is probably responsible
   for its interaction with membranes.
 - Stathmin-like   protein   B3;   which  contains  an  additional  N-terminal
   hydrophobic domain [2].
 - SCG10-like  protein  (SCLIP)  [3];  a  protein  specifically  expressed  in
   neurons.

As signatures  for  proteins  of  the stathmin family, we selected a conserved
decapeptide which  ends  with  the  first  three  residues  of the coiled coil
domain and  a second pattern that corresponds to part of the central region of
the coiled coil.

 EF-1alpha    EF-Tu         Binds GTP and  an aminoacyl-tRNA;  delivers  the
                            latter to the A site of ribosomes.
 EF-1beta     EF-Ts         Interacts with EF-1a/EF-Tu  to  displace GDP and
                            thus allows the regeneration of GTP-EF-1a.
 EF-2         EF-G          Binds GTP and peptidyl-tRNA and translocates the
                            latter from the A site to the P site.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The GTP-binding elongation factor family also includes the following proteins:

 - Eukaryotic  peptide  chain  release  factor GTP-binding subunits [3]. These
   proteins interact  with  release  factors  that bind to ribosomes that have
   encountered a  stop  codon  at  their decoding site and help them to induce
   release of  the  nascent  polypeptide.  The yeast protein was known as SUP2
   (and also as SUP35, SUF12 or GST1) and the human homolog as GST1-Hs.
 - Prokaryotic  peptide  chain release factor 3 (RF-3) (gene prfC).  RF-3 is a
   class-II RF, a GTP-binding  protein  that  interacts  with class I RFs (see
   <PDOC00607>) and enhance their activity [4].
 - Prokaryotic GTP-binding protein lepA and its  homolog  in yeast (gene GUF1)
   and in Caenorhabditis elegans (ZK1236.1).
 - Yeast HBS1 [5].
 - Rat statin S1 [6], a protein of unknown function which is highly similar to
   EF-1alpha.
 - Prokaryotic selenocysteine-specific elongation factor selB [7], which seems
   to replace  EF-Tu  for  the insertion of selenocysteine directed by the UGA
   codon.
 - The tetracycline resistance proteins tetM/tetO [8,9] from various  bacteria
   such as  Campylobacter jejuni, Enterococcus faecalis,  Streptococcus mutans
   and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Tetracycline binds to the prokaryotic ribosomal
   30S subunit and inhibits binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs. These proteins abolish
   the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis.
 - Rhizobium nodulation protein nodQ [10].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein yihK [11].

In EF-1-alpha, a specific region  has  been  shown [12] to  be  involved  in a
conformational change mediated by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This region is
conserved in  both EF-1alpha/EF-Tu as well as EF-2/EF-G and thus seems typical
for GTP-dependent proteins which bind non-initiator tRNAs to the ribosome. The
pattern we  developed  for  this  family  of  proteins  include that conserved
region.

Eukaryotic elongation  factor 1 (EF-1) is  responsible  for  the GTP-dependent
binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs  to  the ribosomes [1].  EF-1  is  composed of four
subunits:  the alpha chain which  binds GTP  and  aminoacyl-tRNAs,   the gamma
chain that probably plays  a  role in anchoring the complex to other  cellular
components and the beta and delta (or beta') chains. The beta and delta chains
are highly similar proteins that  both  stimulate the exchange of GDP bound to
the alpha chain for GTP [2].   The  beta  and  delta  chains  are  hydrophilic
proteins of around 23 to 31 Kd. Their C-terminal part seems  important for the
nucleotide  exchange  activity,   while  the  N-terminal section  is  probably
involved in the interaction with the gamma chain.

We have developed two signature patterns  for  this  family  of  proteins. The
first corresponds  to  an acidic region in the central section; the second, to
the C-terminal extremity of these proteins

Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) (formerly known as eIF-4D) [1,2] is a
small protein whose precise role in the initiation of protein synthesis is not
known. It appears to promote the formation of the first peptide bond.   eIF-5A
seems to be the  only  eukaryotic  protein  to  contain  an  hypusine residue.
Hypusine is  derived  from  lysine  by  the  post-translational  addition of a
butylamino group (from spermidine) to the epsilon-amino group of lysine.   The
hypusine group is essential to the function of eIF-5A.

A hypusine-containing  protein  has  been  found  in  archaebacteria  such  as
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius or Methanococcus jannaschii; this protein is  highly
similar to eIF-5A and could play a similar role in protein biosynthesis.

The signature we developed for eIF-5A is centered around the hypusine residue.

Initiation factor  2  (IF-2)  (gene  infB)  [1]  is  one  of the three factors

a more conserved C-terminal domain.

Bacterial IF-2   is   structurally  and  functionally  related  to  eukaryotic

Peptide chain  release  factors (RFs) are  required  for  the  termination  of
protein biosynthesis [1]. At present two  classes of RFs can be distinguished.
Class I  RFs  bind  to  ribosomes  that have encountered a stop codon at their
decoding site  and induce release of the nascent polypeptide. Class II RFs are
GTP-binding proteins  that  interact  with  class I RFs and enhance class I RF
activity.

In prokaryotes  there  are two class I RFs that act in a codon specific manner
[2]: RF-1 (gene prfA)  mediates UAA  and UAG-dependent  termination while RF-2
(gene prfB)  mediates    UAA  and UGA-dependent termination. RF-1 and RF-2 are

* Calponin family repeat *
**************************

Calponin [1,2] is a thin filament-associated protein that is implicated in the
regulation and  modulation  of  smooth  muscle  contraction.  It is capable of
binding to  actin,  calmodulin, troponin C and tropomyosin. The interaction of
calponin with  actin  inhibits the actomyosin MgATPase activity. Calponin is a
basic protein  of  approximately 34 Kd.  Multiple isoforms are found in smooth
muscles.

Calponin contains three repeats of a well conserved 26 amino acid domain. Such
a domain is also found in a  number of other proteins whose physiological role
is not yet established:

 - Vertebrate  transgelin  (also known as smooth muscle protein SM22-alpha) (1
   copy).
 - Mammalian transgelin 2.
 - Drosophila synchronous flight muscle protein SM20 (1 copy).
 - Rat neuronal protein NP25 [3] (1 copy).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans protein unc-87 [4] (5 copies).
 - An Onchocerca volvulus antigen [5] (5 copies).

Most of these proteins also contain a  N-terminal CH domain (see <PDOC50021>).
The signature pattern for this domain corresponds its first 20 residues.

* CAP protein signatures *
**************************

In budding  and fission yeasts the CAP protein is a bifunctional protein whose
N-terminal domain  binds  to adenylyl cyclase, thereby enabling that enzyme to
be activated  by upstream regulatory signals, such as Ras. The function of the
C-terminal domain  is  less  clear,  but  it  is  required for normal cellular
morphology and  growth  control  [1].  CAP  is  conserved in higher eukaryotic
organisms where its function is not yet clear [2].

Structurally, CAP  is  a  protein  of 474 to 551 residues which consist of two
domains separated  by  a  proline-rich  hinge. We have developed two signature
patterns, one  corresponds  to  a conserved region in the N-terminal extremity
and the other to a C-terminal region.

* Calreticulin family signatures *
**********************************

Calreticulin [1] (also known as calregulin, CRP55 or HACBP) is a high-capacity
calcium-binding protein   which   is  present  in  most  tissues  and  located
at the  periphery  of the  endoplasmic (ER) and the sarcoplamic reticulum (SR)
membranes.  It probably plays a role in the storage of calcium in the lumen of
the ER and SR and  it  may  well have other important functions. Structurally,
calreticulin  is  a protein  of  about 400  amino  acid residues consisting of
three domains:

 a) An N-terminal, probably globular, domain  of about 180 amino acid residues
    (N-domain);
 b) A central domain  of about  70 residues (P-domain)  which  contains  three
    repeats of an acidic 17 amino acid motif. This region binds calcium with a
    low-capacity, but a high-affinity;
 c) A C-terminal domain rich in acidic residues and in lysine (C-domain). This
    region binds calcium with a high-capacity but a low-affinity.

Calreticulin is evolutionary related to the following proteins:

 - Onchocerca volvulus antigen RAL-1. RAL-1 is highly similar to calreticulin,
   but  possesses  a  C-terminal  domain rich in lysine and arginine and lacks
   acidic residues  and  is  therefore  not  expected  to bind calcium in that
   region.
 - Calnexin   [2].   A  calcium-binding  protein  that  interacts  with  newly
   synthesized glycoproteins  in the endoplasmic reticulum. It seems to play a
   major role  in  the quality control apparatus of the ER by the retention of
   incorrectly folded proteins.
 - Calmegin  [3]  (or  calnexin-T),  a testis-specific calcium-binding protein
   highly similar to calnexin.

We developed three signature  patterns for  this family of proteins. The first
two patterns are based on conserved regions in the N-domain; the third pattern
corresponds to positions 4 to 16 of the repeated motif in the P-domain.

* Calsequestrin signatures *
****************************

Calsequestrin is   a  moderate-affinity, high-capacity calcium-binding protein
of cardiac  and  skeletal muscle [1], where it is located in the lumenal space
of the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  terminal  cisternae.  Calsequestrin acts as a
calcium  buffer  and  plays  an important   role  in  the  muscle  excitation-
contraction coupling.  It  is  a highly acidic protein of about 400 amino acid
residues that  binds  more than 40 moles of calcium per mole of protein. There
are at  least two different forms of calsequestrin: one which is expressed  in
cardiac muscles  and  another  in  skeletal  muscles.  Both  forms have highly
similar sequences.

We have developed two signature sequences, the first one corresponds to the N-
terminus of  the  mature  protein;  the second is located just in front of the
C-terminus  of  the  protein  which is  composed  of  a  highly acidic tail of
variable length.

******************************************************
* S-100/ICaBP type calcium binding protein signature *
******************************************************

S-100 are small dimeric acidic calcium and zinc-binding  proteins [1] abundant
in the  brain.   They have two different types of calcium-binding sites: a low
affinity one  with  a  special  structure  and  a  'normal'  EF-hand type high
affinity site. The vitamin-D  dependent  intestinal  calcium-binding  proteins
(ICaBP or calbindin 9 Kd) also belong to this family  of proteins, but it does
not form  dimers.  In the past years the sequences of many new members of this
family have  been  determined  (for  reviews  see  [2,3,4]); in most cases the
function of  these  proteins  is  not yet known, although it is becoming clear
that they  are  involved  in  cell  growth  and  differentiation,  cell  cycle
regulation and metabolic control. These proteins are:

 - Calcyclin  (Prolactin  receptor  associated  protein (PRA); clatropin; 2a9;
   5B10; S100A6).
 - Calpactin I light chain (p10; p11; 42c; S100A10).
 - Calgranulin A (cystic fibrosis antigen (CFAg);  MIF related protein 8 (MRP-
   8); p8; S100A8).
 - Calgranulin B (MIF related protein 14 (MRP-14); p14; S100A9).
 - Calgranulin C.
 - Calgizzarin (S100C).
 - Placental  calcium-binding  protein  (CAPL)  (18a2;  peL98; 42a; p9K; MTS1;
   metastatin; S100A4).
 - Protein S-100D (S100A5).
 - Protein S-100E (S100A3).
 - Protein S-100L (CAN19; S100A2).
 - Placental protein S-100P (S100E).
 - Psoriasin (S100A7).
 - Chemotactic cytokine CP-10 [5].
 - Protein MRP-126 [6].
 - Trichohyalin  [7]. This is a large intermediate filament-associated protein
   that associates with keratin intermediate filaments (KIF); it contains a S-
   100 type domain in its N-terminal extremity.

A number of these proteins are known to bind calcium while others are not (p10
for example).  Our  EF-hand  detecting  pattern (see <PDOC00018>) will fail to
pick those  proteins  which  have  lost  their  calcium-binding properties. We
developed a  pattern  which  unambiguously picks up proteins belonging to this
family. This pattern spans the region of the EF-hand high  affinity  site  but
makes no assumptions on the calcium-binding properties of this site.

* Hemolysin-type calcium-binding region signature *

Gram-negative bacteria  produce  a  number of proteins which are secreted into
the growth medium by a mechanism that  does  not  require a cleaved N-terminal
signal sequence. These proteins, while having different functions, seem [1] to
share two properties: they bind calcium  and they contain a variable number of
tandem repeats consisting of a nine amino acid motif rich in glycine, aspartic
acid and asparagine. It has been shown [2] that such  a  domain is involved in
the binding of calcium ions in a parallel beta roll structure.    The proteins
which are currently known to belong to this category are:

 - Hemolysins from  various  species  of bacteria.   Bacterial  hemolysins are
   exotoxins that attack blood  cell  membranes  and cause  cell rupture.  The
   hemolysins which are known to contain such a domain are those from: E. coli
   (gene hlyA),   A. pleuropneumoniae  (gene appA),   A. actinomycetemcomitans
   and P. haemolytica (leukotoxin) (gene lktA).
 - Cyclolysin from Bordetella pertussis (gene cyaA). A multifunctional protein
   which is both an adenylate cyclase and a hemolysin.
 - Extracellular zinc proteases: serralysin (EC 3.4.24.40) from Serratia, prtB
   and prtC from Erwinia chrysanthemi and aprA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 - Nodulation protein nodO from Rhizobium leguminosarum.

We derived a signature pattern from conserved positions in the sequence of the

Gram-negative bacteria  produce  a  number of proteins which are secreted into
the growth medium by a mechanism that  does  not  require a cleaved N-terminal

help of two or more proteins  for  their  secretion  across the cell envelope.
Amongst which a  protein  belonging  to  the  ABC transporters family (see the
relevant entry  <PDOC00185>)  and  a  protein  belonging  to a family which is
currently composed [1 to 5] of the following members:

 Gene  Species                  Protein which is exported

These proteins  are  evolutionary related and consist of from 390 to 480 amino
acid residues. They  seem to be anchored in the inner membrane by a N-terminal
transmembrane region.  Their  exact  role in the  secretion process is not yet
known.

The C-terminal section of these proteins is the best conserved region; we have
derived a signature pattern from that region.

***************************
* P-II protein signatures *
***************************

The P-II protein (gene glnB) is  a bacterial protein important for the control
of glutamine  synthetase  [1,2,3].  In  nitrogen-limiting conditions, when the
ratio of  glutamine  to  2-ketoglutarate  decreases, P-II is uridylylated on a
tyrosine residue  to  form  P-II-UMP.  P-II-UMP  allows  the  deadenylation of
glutamine synthetase (GS), thus activating the enzyme. Conversely, in nitrogen
excess, P-II-UMP is deuridylated and then promotes the adenylation of GS. P-II
also indirectly controls the transcription of the GS gene (glnA) by preventing
NR-II (ntrB)  to  phosphorylate  NR-I  (ntrC)  which  is  the  transcriptional
activator of glnA. Once P-II is uridylylated, these events are reversed.

P-II is a protein  of about  110 amino acid residues extremely well conserved.
The tyrosine which  is  urydylated  is  located  in  the  central  part of the
protein.

In cyanobacteria,  P-II  seems to be phosphorylated on a serine residue rather
than being urydylated.

In  methanogenic archaebacteria, the  nitrogenase iron  protein gene (nifH) is
followed by two  open reading  frames highly  similar  to the eubacterial P-II
protein [4].  These  proteins could be involved in  the regulation of nitrogen
fixation.

In the  red  alga,  Porphyra  purpurea, there is a glnB homolog encoded in the
chloroplast genome.

Other proteins highly similar to glnB are:

 - Bacillus subtilis protein nrgB [5].
 - Escherichia coli hypothetical protein ybaI [6].

We developed two  signature  patterns  for  P-II protein.  The first one is  a
conserved  stretch  (in eubacteria)   of  six  residues  which   contains  the
urydylated  tyrosine, the other is  derived  from a conserved region in the C-
terminal part of the P-II protein.

* 14-3-3 proteins signatures *
******************************

The 14-3-3 proteins [1,2,3] are a family of closely related acidic homodimeric
proteins of  about 30 Kd which were first identified as being very abundant in
mammalian brain tissues  and located  preferentially  in neurons.   The 14-3-3
proteins seem  to  have  multiple biological activities and play a key role in
signal transduction  pathways  and the cell cycle. They interacts with kinases
such as  PKC or Raf-1; they seem to also  function as protein-kinase dependent
activators of  tyrosine  and  tryptophan  hydroxylases  and in plants they are
associated with a complex that binds to the G-box promoter elements.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins are ubiquitously found in all eukaryotic species
studied and have been sequenced in fungi  (yeast BMH1 and BMH2,  fission yeast
rad24 and rad25), plants, Drosophila, and vertebrates. The  sequences  of  the
14-3-3 proteins  are  extremely  well conserved. As signature patterns we have
selected two  highly  conserved regions: the first is a peptide of 11 residues
located in  the N-terminal section; the second, a 20 amino acid region located
in the C-terminal section.

PLM, MAT8  and CHIF seems to serve as chloride channels or as chloride-channel
regulators.

Except for RIC, all these proteins are very small and their size range from 58
residues for  ATP1G1  to  92 for PLM. RIC is longer (178 residues) due to a N-
terminal extension.  They  all contain a single transmembrane domain. With the
exception of  ATP1G1,  they all seem to have a N-terminal signal peptide. As a
signature pattern,  we  selected  a conserved region that start a few residues
before the  beginning  of the transmembrane domain and that stop four residues
inside that region.

* BTG1 family signatures *
**************************

A novel   family  of  anti-proliferative  proteins  has  been  recently  [1,2]
characterized:

 - Mammalian  and  avian  protein BTG1. BTG1 seems to negatively regulate cell
   proliferation.
 - Mammalian protein BTG2 (also known as PC3 or TIS21).
 - Mammalian protein BTG3 (also known as TOB5).
 - Mammalian  protein  TOB,  an anti-proliferative protein that interacts with
   the erbb-2 receptor tyrosine kinase [3].
 - Human protein TOB4.
 - Xenopus  laevis  maternal  proteins B9.10 and B9.15 (which are probably the
   orthologs of BTG3).

The proteins  have  from  158 to 363 amino acid residues. BTG2 seems to have a
signal sequence; while the other proteins may lack such a domain. The sequence
of the  N-terminal  half  of  these  proteins  is well conserved. As signature
patterns, we  selected  the  two best conserved regions of these proteins. The
first signature pattern includes the only conserved cysteine.

   developmentally programmed  transitions from the G1 phase of the cell cycle
   to the G0 phase or the apoptotic pathway.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans cul-2, cul-3, cul-4 (F45E12.3), cul-5 (ZK856.1) and
   cul-6 (K08E7.7).
 - Mammalian CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A and CUL4B.
 - Mammalian  vasopressin-activated  calcium-mobilizing  receptor  (VACM-1), a

The cullins are hydrophilic proteins of 740 to 815 amino acids. The C-terminal

Recently a family  of small proteins  of about 12 to 16 Kd  has been described
[1,2]. This family currently consists of:

 - Mammalian protein HINT (also known as Protein kinase C inhibitor 1 or PKCI-
   1). HINT  was incorrectly thought to be a specific inhibitor of PKC. It has
   been shown to bind zinc.
 - Fission   yeast   diadenosine   5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate   asymmetrical
   hydrolase  (Ap4Aase) (EC 3.6.1.17) (gene aph1), which cleaves A-5'-PPPP-5'A
   to yield AMP and ATP.
 - FHIT,  a  human protein whose gene is altered in different tumors and which
   acts as  a  diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P3-triphosphate hydrolase (Ap3Aase)
   (EC 3.6.1.29) cleaving A-5'-PPP-5'A to yield AMP and ADP.
 - Yeast proteins HNT1 and HNT2.
 - Maize zinc-binding protein ZBP14.
 - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  ycfF and a related protein in all
   sequence bacterial genomes and some archaeal genomes.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F21C3.3.

All these  proteins  contains  a  region with three clustered histidines. This
region is  responsible for the designation of this family: HIT, for 'HIstidine
Triad [1].  This region was originally thought to be implied in the binding of
a zinc ion but was later identified [3] as part of the alpha-phosphate binding
site of a nucleotide-binding domain.

As a signature pattern, we selected the region of the histidine triad.

* Cornichon family signature *
******************************

The Drosophila  cornichon  protein (gene: cni) [1] is required in the germline
for dorsal-ventral  signaling. The dorsal-ventral pattern formation involves a
reorganization of  the microtubule network correlated with the movement of the
oocyte nucleus,  and  depending  on  the  initial correct establishment of the
anterior-posterior axis  via  a  signal  from the oocyte produced by cornichon
and gurken  and  received  by  torpedo  protein  in  the  follicle  cells. The
biochemical function of the cornichon protein is currently not known.

It is  a  protein  of  144  residues that seems to contain three transmembrane
regions. It is evolutionary related to the following eukaryotic proteins:

 - Yeast  ERV14  [2],  probably  involved  in  regulation of secretory protein
   export.
 - Human and mouse [3] cornichon proteins (gene cnih).
 - Mouse cornichon-like protein (gene cnil).
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein T09E8.3.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YBR210W.
 - Schizosaccharomyces pombe hypothetical protein SpAC2C4.05.

The high  conservatiion of this family throughout evolution suggests a role in
basic cellular functions.

As a  signature  for  these proteins we selected a conserved region located in
the loop  between  the  first and second transmembrane regions. This conserved
region contains three acidic residues.

Ependymins [1,2,3]  are  the  predominant  proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid

memory and neuronal  regeneration.  They  are glycoproteins of about 200 amino
acids that  can  bind calcium. Four cysteines are conserved that probably form
disulfide bonds.

We developed two signature patterns for ependymins.  The first one corresponds

and which  include a conserved cysteine residue. The second pattern is located
in the C-terminal section and also includes one of the conserved cysteines.

* Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme signature *
**********************************************

Ornithine decarboxylase  antizyme  (ODC-AZ)  [1]  binds  to, and destabilizes,
ornithine decarboxylase  (ODC),  a  key  enzyme in polyamine synthesis. ODC is
then rapidly degraded. The expression of ODC-AZ requires programmed, ribosomal
frameshifting which  is  modulated  according to the cellular concentration of
polyamines.  High levels of polyamines induce a +1 ribosomal frameshift in the
translation of  mRNA  for  the  antizyme  leading to the expression of a full-
length protein.

At least  three forms  of ODC-AZ exist in mammals [3] and the protein has been
found in Drosophila (protein Gutfeeling).

As a  signature  pattern,  we  selected  a  highly  conserved region in the C-
terminal part of these proteins.

* Syntaxin / epimorphin family signature *
******************************************

The following proteins have been shown to be evolutionary related [1,2,3]:

 - Epimorphin (or syntaxin 2),  a mammalian mesenchymal protein which plays an
   essential role in epithelial morphogenesis.
 - Syntaxin  1A  (also  known  as  antigen  HPC-1)  and  syntaxin 1B which are
   synaptic proteins  which may be involved in docking of synaptic vesicles at
   presynaptic active zones.
 - Syntaxin 3.
 - Syntaxin  4,  which is potentially involved in docking of synaptic vesicles
   at presynaptic active zones.
 - Syntaxin 5, which mediates endoplasmic reticulum to golgi transport.
 - Syntaxin 6, which is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
 - Syntaxin 7.
 - Yeast  PEP12  (or VPS6) which is required for the transport of proteases to
   the vacuole.
 - Yeast  SED5 which is required for the fusion of transport vesicles with the
   Golgi complex.
 - Yeast SSO1 and SSO2  which are  required for vesicle fusion with the plasma
   membrane.
 - Yeast VAM3, which is required for vacuolar assembly.
 - Arabidopsis thaliana protein KNOLLE which may be involved in cytokinesis.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical proteins F35C8.4, F48F7.2, F55A11.2 and
   T01B11.3.

The above  proteins  share  the following characteristics: a size ranging from
30 Kd  to  40  Kd;  a  C-terminal extremity which is highly hydrophobic and is
probably involved  in  anchoring  the protein to the membrane; a central, well
conserved region, which seems to be in a coiled-coil conformation.

The pattern specific for  this family is based on the most conserved region of
the coiled coil domain.

* Extracellular proteins SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7 signatures *
************************************************************

A variety  of  extracellular  proteins  from  eukaryotes have been found to be
evolutionary related:

 - Rodent  sperm-coating  glycoprotein (SCP), also  known as acidic epididymal
   glycoprotein (AEG) .  This  protein  is  thought  to  be  involved in sperm
   maturation [1]. It is a protein of about 220 residues and probably contains
   eight disulfide bonds.
 - Mammalian  testis-specific  protein  Tpx-1  [2]. Tpx-1 is highly related to
   SCP's.
 - Mammalian glioma pathogenesis-related protein (GliPR).
 - Lizard helothermine, a toxin that blocks ryanodine receptors.
 - Venom  allergen 5  (Ag5)  from vespid wasps and venom allergen 3 (Ag3) from
   fire ants.  These  proteins  are potent allergens and are the main cause of
   allergic reactions  to  stings  from insects of the hymenoptera family [3].
   Ag5/3 are proteins of about 200 residues and  contain four disulfide bonds.
 - Plant  pathogenesis  proteins  of  the  PR-1 family [4]. These proteins are
   synthesized during  pathogen  infection  or other stress-related responses.
   They are proteins of about 130 to 140 residues  and  probably contain three
   disulfide bonds.
 - Proteins  Sc7  and Sc14 from the basidomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune.
   These extracellular  proteins are loosely associated with fruit body hyphal
   walls [5].  Sc7/14  are proteins of about 180 residues and probably contain
   two disulfide bonds.
 - Ancylostoma secreted protein from dog hookworm.
 - Yeast hypothetical proteins YJL078c, YJL079c and YKR013w.

The exact function of these proteins is not yet known.  As signature patterns,
we selected two conserved regions located in their C-terminal half. The second
signature contains a  cysteine  which is known  to be involved  in a disulfide
bond in Ag5.

Mammalian fetuin  [1,2,3,4],  also called alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, bone sialic
acid-containing protein  (BSP),  countertrypin  or  PP63,  is  expressed  in a
tissue- and  development-specific  pattern  which  seems  to  be significantly
different between  species.  A  wide  functional  diversity of fetuin has been
observed. Human fetuin is a heterodimer of chain A and B, which are derived by
cleavage of a connecting peptide from a common precursor. It is synthesized in
liver and selectively concentrated in bone matrix. Human fetuin has been shown
to be  involved in immune response, bone formation and resorption. Fetuins are
characterized by  the presence of 2 N-terminally located cystatin-like repeats
(see <PDOC00259>) and a unique C-terminal domain which is not present in other
proteins of the cystatin family [1,2].

Proteins that belong to the fetuin family also include:

 - Mammalian fetuin-B [5].
 - Snake  antihemorragic  factor  (HSF),  a  metalloproteinase inhibitor which
   prevents hemorrhagic and proteolytic activities of the venom.

As shown in the schematic representation this domain contains twelve conserved
cysteines involved in six disulfide bonds.

* Legume lectins signatures *
*****************************

Leguminous plants synthesize  sugar-binding proteins  which  are called legume
lectins [1,2].   These lectins are  generally found  in the  seeds.  The exact
function of legume lectins  is  not  known   but  they  may be involved in the
attachment of  nitrogen-fixing  bacteria  to  legumes  and  in  the protection
against pathogens.   Legume  lectins  bind  calcium  and  manganese (or  other
transition metals).

Legume lectins are synthesized as precursor proteins of about 230 to 260 amino
acid residues.  Some  legume  lectins are proteolytically processed to produce
two chains: beta (which corresponds to the N-terminal) and alpha (C-terminal).
The lectin concanavalin A (conA) from jack bean is exceptional in that the two
chains are transposed  and ligated (by formation of a new peptide  bond).  The
N-terminus of mature conA thus corresponds to that of the  alpha chain and the
C-terminus to the beta chain.

We have developed two signature patterns specific to legume lectins: the first
is  located  in  the  C-terminal  section  of  the  beta  chain and contains a
conserved aspartic acid   residue  important  for  the  binding of calcium and
manganese; the second one is located in the N-terminal of the alpha chain.

**********************
* Galaptin signature *
**********************

All vertebrates  synthesize soluble  galactoside-binding lectins [1,2,3] (also
known as   galectins,   galaptins  or  S-lectin).  These  carbohydrate-binding
proteins are  developmentally  regulated.   Although their exact physiological
role is  not  yet  clear they seem to be involved in differentiation, cellular
regulation and   tissue  construction.  The  sequence  of  galactoside-binding
lectins from  electric eel (electrolectin), conger eel (congerin), chicken and
a number of mammalian  species  is  known. These lectins are proteins of about
130 to 140 amino acid residues (14 Kd to 16 Kd).

A number of other proteins are known to belong to this family:

 - Galectin-3 (also known as MAC-2 antigen; CBP-35 or IgE-binding protein), a
   35 Kd lectin which  binds  immunoglobulin  E and  which  is composed of two
   domains: a  N-terminal  domain that consist of tandem repeats of a glycine/
   proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal galaptin domain.
 - Galectin-4 [4], which is composed of two galaptin domains.
 - Galectin-5.
 - Galectin-7 [5], a keratinocyte protein which could be involved in cell-cell
   and/or cell-matrix interactions necessary for normal growth control.
 - Galectin-8 [6], which is composed of two galaptin domains.
 - Galectin-9 [7], which is composed of two galaptin domains.
 - Human eosinophil lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5) [8] (Charcot-Leyden crystal
   protein), a   protein  that  may  have  both  an  enzymatic  and  a  lectin
   activities. It   forms   hexagonal  bipyramidal  crystals  in  tissues  and
   secretions from sites of eosinophil-associated inflammation.
 - Caenorhabditis  elegans  32  Kd  lactose-binding lectin [9]. This lectin is
   composed of two galaptin domains.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans lec-7 and lec-8.

One of the conserved regions of these lectins  contains a  tryptophan that has
been shown [10] to be essential to the binding of galactosides.  We  have used
this region as a signature pattern for these proteins.

Lysosome-associated membrane  glycoproteins (lamp) [1] are  integral  membrane
proteins, specific to lysosomes,  and whose exact biological  function  is not
yet clear.   Structurally,  the  lamp proteins   consist  of   two  internally
homologous  lysosome-luminal domains separated by a proline-rich hinge region;
at the C-terminal extremity there is a transmembrane region followed by a very
short cytoplasmic tail.   In each  of  the  duplicated domains, there  are two
conserved disulfide bonds. This structure is schematically  represented in the
figure below.

In mammals, there are two closely related types of lamp: lamp-1 and lamp-2. In
chicken lamp-1 is known as LEP100.

The macrophage protein  CD68 (or macrosialin) [2] is  a  heavily  glycosylated
integral membrane  protein whose structure  consists  of  a  mucin-like domain
followed by a proline-rich hinge; a  single lamp-like domain;  a transmembrane
region and a short cytoplasmic tail.

We developed two signature patterns for this family of proteins. The first one
is centered  on the  first  conserved  cysteine of the duplicated domains. The
second corresponds  to  a  region  that  includes  the extremity of the second
domain, the totality of the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail.

Glycophorin A is  the  major sialoglycoprotein  of  erythrocyte  membrane [1].
Structurally, glycophorin  A  consists of an  N-terminal extracellular domain,
heavily  glycosylated   on   serine and   threonine  residues,   followed by a

In human there are two closely related forms: glycophorin A  which carries the

The best conserved region of glycophorin A  is the transmembrane domain and we

* PMP-22 / EMP / MP20 family signatures *
*****************************************

The following   vertebrate   small   integral   membrane   glycoproteins   are
evolutionary related [1,2,3]:

 - Peripheral  myelin  protein 22 (PMP-22), which is expressed in many tissues
   but mainly  by  Schwann  cells  as  a component of myelin of the peripheral
   nervous system  (PNS).  PMP-22  probably plays a role both in myelinization
   and in  cell  proliferation. Mutations affecting PMP-22 are associated with
   hereditary motor  and  sensory  neuropathies  such  as  Charcot-Marie-Tooth
   disease type 1A (CMT-1A) in human or the 'trembler' phenotype in mice.
 - Eye lens specific membrane protein 20 (MP20 or MP19).
 - Epithelial  membrane  protein-1  (EMP-1) (also  kwown  as  tumor-associated
   membrane protein (TMP) or as squamous cell-specific protein Cl-20).
 - Epithelial membrane protein-2 (EMP-2) (also kwown as XMP).
 - Epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP-3) (also kwown as YMP).

These are  proteins  of about 160 to 173 amino acid residues that contain four
transmembrane segments.  PMP-22,  EMP-1,  -2  and -3 are highly similar, while
MP20 is more distantly related.

We selected  two  conserved  regions  as signature patterns, the first pattern
includes the end of the first transmembrane region and part of the loop before
the second  region.  The second pattern corresponds to the third transmembrane
region.

The claudins  [1]  are  a  family of integral membrane proteins that are major

* Oxysterol-binding protein family signature *
**********************************************

A number of eukaryotic proteins that seem to be involved with sterol synthesis
and/or its regulation have been found [1] to be evolutionary related:

 - Mammalian  oxysterol-binding  protein (OSBP). A protein of about 800 amino-
   acid residues that binds a variety of oxysterols: oxygenated derivatives of
   cholesterol. OSBP seems to play a complex role in the  regulation of sterol
   metabolism.
 - Yeast proteins HES1 and KES1; highly related proteins of  434 residues that
   seem to play a role in ergosterol synthesis.
 - Yeast  OSH1, a protein of 859 residues that also plays a role in ergosterol
   synthesis.
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR001w (437 residues).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YHR073w (996 residues).
 - Yeast hypothetical protein YKR003w (448 residues).

All these proteins contain a moderately conserved domain of about 250 residues
located in  the  C-terminal  half of OBSP, OSH1 and YHR073w and in the central
section of  the  other  proteins. As a signature pattern, we selected the best
conserved part   of   this   domain,   a  region  that  contains  a  conserved
pentapeptide.

Seminal vesicle  protein  I (SVP-1)  [1]  is one  of  the four major secretory

The serum  amyloid  A  (SAA) proteins comprise a family of vertebrate proteins

1000 fold)  in  inflammation;  thus  making  SAA a major acute phase reactant.
While the major physiological function of SAA is unclear, prolonged elevation
of plasma  SAA  levels,  as  in  chronic  inflammation,  however, results in a
pathological condition,  called  amyloidosis,  which affects the liver, kidney
and spleen  and which is characterized by the highly insoluble accumulation of
SAA in these tissues.

***********************************

A family of mammalian sperm  proteins  has been  recently characterized [1,2].
The proteins that are currently known to belong to this family are:

 - Pig spermadhesins AQN-1, AQN-3 and AWN-1. These proteins are synthesized by
   the sexual  accessory  glands  and becomes attached to the sperm surface at
   the time  of  ejaculation. They bind to the ZP-glycoproteins and to heparin
   and seems to inhibit serine protease inhibitors.
 - Bovine acidic seminal fluid protein (ASFP), which seems to be growth factor
   with effects on ovarian granulosa cells.
 - Pig major seminal plasma glycoproteins PSP-I and PSP-II.
 - Bovine seminal plasma protein Z13.

As shown in the following schematic representation these proteins,  which have
from 110 to 130 amino acid residues, contain four conserved cysteines involved
in two disulfide bonds.

* Stress-induced proteins SRP1/TIP1 family signature *
******************************************************

It has  been  recently shown [1]  that three yeast proteins,  two of which are
known to be induced by various stress conditions, are structurally related and
are probably part of a larger family. These proteins are listed below.

 - Cold-shock  inducible  protein  TIR1  (also  known as serine-rich protein 1
   (SRP1)). TIR1 is induced by glucose [2] and cold shock [3].
 - Temperature-shock inducible protein 1 (TIP1).  TIP1 can be induced  by both
   cold and heat shocks [4].
 - Cold-shock inducible protein TIR2 (SRP2) [3].
 - Seripauperins, which are closely related protein of about 13 Kd (120 to 124
   residues) which are generally encoded at the extremity of yeast chromosomes
   [5]. The    known   members  of  this  family  are: PAU1, PAU2, PAU3, PAU4,
   PAU5, PAU6,  YBR301w,  YGL261c,  YGR294w,  YHL046c,  YIL176c,  YIR041w  and
   YKL224c.
 - Hypothetical protein YIL011w.
 - Hypothetical protein YJR150c.
 - Hypothetical protein YJR151c.

These proteins all seem to start with a putative signal sequence followed by a
conserved domain  of  about 90 residues. In TIR1, TIR2, TIP1, YIL011w, YJR150c
and YJR151c,  this  domain is followed by a repetitive serine and alanine rich
region absent in the other members of this family.

As a signature pattern for this protein family, we selected a region at the C-
terminus of the conserved domain.

Structurally, these proteins consist of three separate domains:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) An  extracellular  domain of about 500 residues that contains 12 conserved
    cysteines probably involved in disulfide bonds and which also contains the
    sites of attachment of the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan side chains;
 c) A  C-terminal  hydrophobic  region  which  is post-translationally removed
    after formation of the GPI-anchor.

The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Glypican 1 (GPC1).
 - Glypican 2 (GPC2) or cerebroglycan.
 - Glypican 3 (GPC3) or OCI-5.  In man,  defects in GPC3 are the cause of a X-

Syndecans [1,2]  (from  the  greek  syndein; to bind together) are a family of
transmembrane heparan  sulfate  proteoglycans  which  are  implicated  in  the
binding of extracellular matrix components and growth factors. Syndecans bind
a variety  of  molecules  via  their  heparan  sulfate  chains  and can act as
receptors or as co-receptors.

Structurally, these proteins consist of four separate domains:

 a) A signal sequence;
 b) An extracellular domain (ectodomain) of variable length and whose sequence
    is not  evolutionary  conserved  in  the  various  forms of syndecans. The
    ectodomain contains  the  sites  of  attachment  of  the  heparan  sulfate
    glycosaminoglycan side chains;
 c) A transmembrane region;
 d) A  highly  conserved  cytoplasmic  domain of about 30 to 35 residues which
    could interact with cytoskeletal proteins.

The proteins known to belong to this family are:

 - Syndecan 1.
 - Syndecan 2 or fibroglycan.
 - Syndecan 3 or neuroglycan or N-syndecan.
 - Syndecan 4 or amphiglycan or ryudocan.
 - Drosophila syndecan.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans probable syndecan (F57C7.3).

The signature  pattern  that  we  developed for syndecans starts with the last
residue of  the transmembrane region and includes the first 10 residues of the
cytoplasmic domain. This region, which contains four basic residues, could act
as a stop transfer site.

* Tub family signatures *
*************************

The mouse  tubby mutation is  the  cause  of  maturity-onset  obesity, insulin
resistance and  sensory  deficits.  This  mutation  maps to a gene, tub [1,2],
which codes for a protein that belongs to a family which currently consists of
the following members:

 - Mammalian tub, an hydrophilic protein of about 500 residues, which could be
   involved in the hypothalamic regulation of body weight.
 - Human    protein   TULP1 [3] is involved in retinis pigmentosa 14 (RP14), a
   retinal degeneration disease.
 - Human protein TULP2 [3].
 - Mammalian protein TULP3 [4].
 - Mouse protein p4-6 whose function is not known.
 - Caenorhabditis elegans hypothetical protein F10B5.4.
 - Several fragmentary sequences from plants, Drosophila and human ESTs.

While the  N-terminal  part of these protein is not conserved in length nor in
the sequence,  the  C-terminal 250 residues are highly conserved. We therefore
selected two regions in the C-terminal part as signature patterns.  The second
region is  located  at  the  C-terminal  extremity  and contains a penultimate
cysteine residue  that  could  be  critical to the normal functioning of these
proteins.

* HCP repeats signature *
*************************

The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HCP) of sarcoplasmic reticulum [1]
may play a role in the  regulation of  calcium sequestration or release in the
SR of skeletal and cardiac muscle. This protein is very acidic (31% of Asp and
Glu) and rich in histidine (13%).  The sequence  of  HCP  contains  10  tandem
repeats of  a 26 to 29 amino acid residues domain.  This domain starts with an
invariant hexapeptide (HRHRGH),  followed by a stretch of acidic residues. The
end of the domain consist of an almost invariant nonapeptide (STESDRHQA).  The
highly acidic  central  cores of each repeat  are  likely  to  constitute  the
calcium-binding sites of HCP.

The pattern we have developed comprises  the beginning  of the domain and part
of the central acidic stretch.

Some Gram-negative bacteria  express proteins that  enable them to promote the
nucleation of ice at relatively high temperature (above -5 degree Celsius) [1,
2,3]. These proteins are localized at the surface of the outer membrane of the
bacteria and  can  cause  frost  injury  to  many  plant  species. The primary
structure of  these   ice-nucleation proteins is highly repetitive.  A central
repetitive domain  represents about 80% of the total sequence.  This domain is
mainly formed  by the repetition of a conserved region of forty eight residues
(48-mer).  The 48-mers are themselves composed of three blocks  of 16 residues
(16-mer). The  first eight residues of each of these 16-mers are identical. It
has been proposed that the repetitive domain  may be  directly responsible for
aligning water molecules in the seed crystal.

Plant seed storage proteins, whose  principal function appears to be the major
nitrogen  source for the developing plant,  can be classified, on the basis of
their structure, into different families.  11-S are non-glycosylated  proteins
which form hexameric structures [1,2].  Each of the subunits in the hexamer is
itself composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor
and linked  by a  disulfide bond.   This  structure is  shown in the following
representation.

A number of proteins are  produced  by  plants  that  experience water-stress.
Water-stress takes place  when  the  water  available to a plant falls below a
critical level.  The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) appears to modulate the
response of plant to water-stress. Proteins  that  are expressed during water-
stress are  called dehydrins [1,2] or LEA group 2 proteins [3].  The  proteins
that belong to this family are listed below.

 - Arabidopsis thaliana XERO 1, XERO 2 (LTI30), RAB18, ERD10 (LTI45) ERD14 and
   COR47.
 - Barley dehydrins B8, B9, B17, and B18.

 - Tomato TAS14.
 - Wheat dehydrin RAB 15 and cold-shock protein cor410, cs66 and cs120.

Dehydrins share  a  number of  structural features. One  of  the  most notable
features is the presence, in  their  central  region,  of a continuous  run of
five to nine serines followed by a cluster of  charged residues. Such a region
has been  found  in  all  known dehydrins so  far  with  the  exception of pea
dehydrins. A second  conserved  feature is  the  presence  of  two copies of a
lysine-rich octapeptide; the  first copy  is  located just after  the  cluster
of charged residues  that  follows  the poly-serine region and the second copy
is found at the C-terminal extremity. We have have derived  signature patterns
for both regions.

Oleosins [1] are the proteinaceous  components of plants' lipid storage bodies
called oil bodies. Oil bodies are small droplets (0.2 to 1.5 mu-m in diameter)
containing  mostly  triacylglycerol  that  are  surrounded  by a phospholipid/
oleosin annulus. Oleosins may have a  structural role in stabilizing the lipid
body during dessication of the seed, by  preventing  coalescence of  the  oil.
They may  also  provide recognition signals for specific lipase  anchorage  in
lipolysis  during seedling growth.  Oleosins are found in the monolayer lipid/
water interface  of oil bodies and probably  interact with both the lipid  and
phospholipid moieties.

Oleosins are proteins of 16 Kd to 24 Kd  and are composed of three domains: an
N-terminal  hydrophilic region of  variable length (from 30 to 60 residues); a
central  hydrophobic  domain of about 70 residues and a C-terminal amphipathic
region of  variable length (from 60 to 100 residues).  The central hydrophobic
domain is proposed to be made up of beta-strand structure and to interact with
the lipids  [2].  It is  the  only domain  whose sequence  is conserved and we
have therefore selected a section from that domain  as a signature pattern.

* Pathogenesis-related proteins Bet v I family signature *
**********************************************************

A number of plant proteins, which  all seem to be involved in pathogen defense
response, are structurally related [1,2,3]. These proteins are:

 - Bet v I,  the major pollen allergen from white birch.  Bet v I is  the main
   cause of type I allergic reactions in Europe, North America and USSR.
 - Aln g I, the major pollen allergen from alder.
 - Api G I, the major allergen from celery.
 - Car b I, the major pollen allergen from hornbeam.
 - Cor a I, the major pollen allergen from hazel.
 - Mal d I, the major pollen allergen from apple.
 - Asparagus wound-induced protein AoPR1.
 - Kidney bean pathogenesis-related proteins 1 and 2.
 - Parsley pathogenesis-related proteins PR1-1 and PR1-3.
 - Pea disease resistance response proteins pI49, pI176 and DRRG49-C.
 - Pea abscisic acid-responsive proteins ABR17 and ABR18.
 - Potato pathogenesis-related proteins STH-2 and STH-21.
 - Soybean stress-induced protein SAM22.

These proteins  are  thought  to be intracellularly located. They contain from
155 to  160  amino  acid  residues.  As  a  signature  pattern,  we selected a
conserved region located in the third quarter of these proteins.

* Thaumatin family signature *
******************************

Thaumatin [1] is an intensively  sweet-tasting  protein (100 000 times sweeter
than sucrose  on  a  molar  basis)  from  Thaumatococcus daniellii, an African
brush. The protein is  made  of  about  200  residues and contains 8 disulfide
bonds. A number of proteins have been found to be related to thaumatins. These
protein are listed below (references are only provided for recently determined
sequences).

 - A maize alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor.
 - Two  tobacco  pathogenesis-related  proteins:  PR-R  major and minor forms,
   which are induced after infection with viruses.
 - Salt-induced protein NP24 from tomato.
 - Osmotin, a salt-induced protein from tobacco.
 - Osmotin-like proteins OSML13, OSML15 and OSML81 from potato [2].
 - P21, a leaf protein from soybean.
 - PWIR2, a leaf protein from wheat.
 - Zeamatin, a maize antifunal protein [3].

The exact  biological function  of all these  proteins is  not yet known. As a
signature pattern, we selected a conserved region that includes three cysteine
residues known (in thaumatin) to be involved in disulfide bonds.
