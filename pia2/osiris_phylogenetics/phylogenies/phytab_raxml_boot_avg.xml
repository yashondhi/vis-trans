**What it does**

Finds bootstrap probabilities (support values from 0 to 100) in a
Phytab file with phylogenetic trees generated by RAxML, and averages
them. The probabilities are found between brackets ('[]') in the 
output at the ends of branches; each branch is WEIGHED EQUALLY.

See source code comments for methodology. It is recommended that you
consult and understand the source code before use.
