**What it does**

LB pruner will find the average of all branch lengths in each Newick tree. Given the user-input multiplier value (M), if any branch is longer than Mx 
the average branch length, that gene will be written to the tab-delimited output file. See outputs section for more information.

------

**Inputs**

Sequence data file in phytab or FASTA. 

Phytab description: http://osiris-phylogenetics.blogspot.com/2012/09/introduction-to-phytab-format.html

Input a table as follows:::
    name        newick_tree;
    name2	newick_tree;
    name3	newick_tree;

Enter a value for M, the multiplier.

------

**Outputs**

Tab delimited file listing any genes longer than Mx the average branch length for each Newick tree. If an internal branch is longer than M times the 
average then all members of that clade are written to the out file, with 999 as the length of each branch. The third column is branch length, fourth 
column is average branch length for each tree.
