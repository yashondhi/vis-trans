**What it does**

Takes tabular file with bootstrap probabilities in the last column and outputs the same tabular file, but without the lines containing bootstrap
probabilities below user-defined value.

Designed to be used in conjunction with phytab_raxml_boot_avg, which calculates mean probabilities per RAxML tree.

------

**Inputs**

Tabular file; with each line formatted as follows (not including quotes): "[name of tree] [bootstrap probability]".

------

**Outputs**

Tabular file; each line is formatted as follows (not including quotes): "[name of tree] [bootstrap probability]". Does not contain line with
bootstrap probabilities below user-defind threshold.

-------

**Additional Information**

Requires Python 2.
