**What it does**

Tree support RAxML calculates support values for a given tree using a set of input trees. For example, it can calculate bootstrap support for the ML tree based on a set of trees from a bootstrap analysis.
This is valuable when separating bootstrap analysis from ML analysis, and when separating bootstrap replicates in different runs, which can be concatenated and used as input for this tool.
